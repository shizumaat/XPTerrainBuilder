# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 20260725 — RUNWAY-END + POCKET + OLS ROUND: HANDOFF
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Everything is UNCOMMITTED in the working tree. Six gates are default ON
# by owner ruling ("Turn them all on now, I will test in X-Plane").
# BOTH BLOCKERS RESOLVED 2026-07-25 PM (supervised session, Fable lead +
# Opus implementers) — owner is UNBLOCKED for in-sim testing.

## THE TWO BLOCKERS — BOTH FIXED (details below, originals kept for record)

### B1 FIXED — collared pockets now stand the adjacent-ground bands down
Ruling taken: candidate (a), via the CROSSING-INFLUENCE-ZONE pattern (a
published non-shape zone), NOT by unioning the pocket into `static_union`
(which would have fed `_split_zone_rows_off_static` and evicted zone rows).
 * `gap_fill.collared_pocket_zone_union/_prepared` — union of
   `pocket_collars` pockets whose rings ACTUALLY emitted (`chains > 0`;
   an economy-skipped collar keeps its bands — verified `chains` is the
   faithful emission key).
 * `adjacent_ground`: station-level stand-down in `_station_reference_ex`
   (reason "collared_pocket", ALL families, not taxiway-only like the
   crossing zone) + ZERO-buffer polygon clip block (weld ruling: exact
   geometry, no standoff groove). Per-part bbox pre-filter keeps the cost
   at ~35 ms/airport (raw predicate measured 450 ms — 75 % of the 1 %
   HARD-LAW threshold; the guard is semantically exact and test-pinned).
 * `verification`: MIRROR 4 in `_adjacent_ground_stations` (lockstep) +
   NEW invariant `check_collar_ring_band_overlap` (STRtree, band eroded
   1 cm; counts key `collar_ring_in_band`) — the check that would have
   caught B1; there was previously NO collar×band assertion anywhere, and
   MIRROR 3 actively hid the symptom.
 * Emit ordering was already sufficient: collar (pipeline ~6666) runs
   before bands (~6717); with shipped gates the emitter RE-MARCHES inline,
   so the zone is visible. The presolve construct march CANNOT see the
   collar (needs solved pavement altitudes) — the clip block is what
   protects the frozen-footprint gate state.
 * SPJC end-to-end: 2 pockets → 364,240 m² zone, 1,026 stations stood
   down, overlap invariant = 0 findings. +13 tests.
 * No new gate: collar off ⇒ no zone ⇒ bands byte-identical.

### B2 FIXED — weld-inserted T-vertices now bounded by the cut law
HYPOTHESIS REFUTED (there is no `_build_cut_bands`; the emitter is
LAWFUL — all 24 SPJC RESA vertices at min(ceiling, DEM) at emission).
Real mechanism, proven by per-pass attribution: the final epsilon-wedge
weld `enforce_conformance` (pipeline ~6811) inserted T-vertices (n=24→32)
valued by PLAIN LERP (conformance.py "3. plain lerp"); on the RESA
outer/daylight row both hosts are ceiling-limited so the lerp IS the
analytic ceiling, floating +2.12/+2.22 m over a DEM depression between
stations. Donor-adopt and overlay-donor paths both structurally
unreachable for this ref.
 * FIX: `enforce_conformance(dem=, tile_lat=, tile_lon=)` (same trio the
   clearance/OLS emitters consume; DEM parity verified — `_projection_*`
   at the call site are the exact objects handed to the emitters). Inserts
   into CUT-ONLY receivers (`ref runway_end_resa`, roles
   `runway_clearance`/`ols_cut`; fill-only ref `runway_end_skirt` VETOES)
   are bounded min(value, DEM) as a FINAL bound after any valuation path —
   the receiver's OWN law re-applied, so the coincident-adopt
   value-authority guard stands. Gate `O4_CONFORMANCE_CUT_CLAMP` default
   ON, off ⇒ byte-identical. ~0.5 µs/insert. +8 tests
   (tests/test_conformance_cut_clamp.py).
 * ★ KNOWN LIMITATION LEFT ON RECORD: the RESA outer-row SURFACE between
   stations still floats above terrain where daylight distances jump
   (SPJC 16R: chords +2.65 m / +2.28 m worst over ~60 m spans at
   140→120→60→6 m daylight steps) — the vertex clamp cannot fix polygon
   interiors. If the owner sees a floating wedge near 16R in-sim, the fix
   is densifying the outer daylight row in `_build_graded_strips` (the
   flank discontinuity-split pattern at clearance.py ~3205) — touches
   every graded strip, needs build-time evaluation. Do NOT lift the outer
   row to max(ceiling, DEM) — part 30f tried and reverted it.
 * Separate defect spawned as chip: the weld can insert DUPLICATE
   T-vertices at identical coords (SPJC #26/#27, zero-length edge).

## LANDED THIS ROUND (all uncommitted, all in the working tree)

Origin: two owner in-sim defects at SPJC.
 * 16R end had NO RESA anywhere — Pass C has not run since the B4 flip
   (2026-07-15) gated the legacy clearance chain off; the skirt is
   FILL-only by ruling; `adjacent_ground_envelope` declines runway ends.
   Measured: 138/1829 corridor samples breach the 5 % ramp, worst +6.76 m.
 * Five owner coordinates were ring vertices of ONE 158,651 m² flat
   `gap_pit_floor` plateau standing ~3 m proud of the taxiways on an 8 m
   axis-aligned sample staircase.

ARC A (runway ends)
 A1 `grade_law.runway_end_envelope` — ONE law, BOTH bounds (skirt floor +
    RESA ceiling). `runway_end_corridor_half_width_m`. Two pure lockstep
    helpers: `adjacent_ground_end_pin_flags`, `runway_strip_band_width_m`.
    `verification.check_runway_end_skirt` now two-sided (`end_rise`).
 A2 RESA cut inside `clearance.emit_runway_end_skirts` (NOT by reviving
    the legacy chain), ref `runway_end_resa`, cut-only `min(ceiling,DEM)`.
    SPJC 16R: 1 shape, 5652 m². CYXY 3/12226 m². HECA 1/37329 m².
    SPLP correctly silent.
 A3 end-skip bench pin — the 16R west wing no longer collapses
    diagonally; depth over the last 60 m went 57.5/52.5/120.5/60.4 ->
    206.9/226.8/246.0/229.6.
 A4 runway strip width from the CENTERLINE. NOTE: A4 clamps the **FILL
    ONLY**. Clamping the cut erased zone 3 (ICAO §3.4.16 governs the
    ungraded strip out to the FULL strip edge) — that was a functional
    regression, since corrected.
 + `Runway.published_width_m` / `.declared_width_m` (UNGATED): `pipeline`
    overwrites `width_m` with runway+shoulders (SPJC 45->81 m) and that
    was feeding Annex 14 §3.5.3's "twice the runway width". Corridor now
    sizes 75 m not 81 m. **The only ungated behaviour change this round.**

ARC B (enclosed pockets)
 B1 collar rings for width-skipped pockets (`O4_POCKET_COLLAR_RINGS`).
 B2 pit floor v2 — local ring-2 reference, sloped, daylight rim, welds.
 + OWNER RULING 2026-07-24: `GAP_FILL_INTERIOR_FLOOR_ENABLED` **default
   OFF** — "once we're past the grade law zones on a large infield, we
   want to blend back into DEM". This RESTORES the round-8 design ("Terrain
   INSIDE ring 2 stays open-floor"). It DELETED the planned pit-clip-truth
   slice (no pit ⇒ no pit rim ⇒ no pit-rim/collar-chain slivers) and more
   than doubled drainage-rim coverage (weighted mean 8.6 % -> 18.3 %,
   bands 244 -> 300). HECA's artifact pits now ride raw DEM; if that
   matters the answer is an ENCLOSURE test, not flipping the gate back.

OLS ARC (docs/specs/obstacle-limitation-surfaces-spec.md, new)
 Law + constants + STANDARDS rows; new `src/auto_patch/ols.py` (vectorized
 raster pre-scan, island labelling, mountain refusal, banded cut emission);
 `verification.check_ols_surfaces`; pipeline wiring; snap + decimation;
 cross-tile seam determinism (boundary-touching islands refused whole).
 Scope ruling: ONLY transitional + approach-first-section, cut-only.
 Inner-horizontal/conical REFUSED as cuts (they decapitate every hill
 within 4 km above +45 m — at SPLP a mountain range).
 ★ ROAD/RAIL/WATER MASK ADDED 2026-07-25 (owner report): `ols.py` had NO
   infrastructure handling — the only terrain law in the subsystem that
   ignored it. Now masks `clearance._surface_road_corridors`, the skirt's
   own source. WHY IT CANNOT BE DEM-DETECTED: the airport-smoothed DEM
   does not CONTAIN the road cut — a transect across a cutting 210 m off
   the 16R end reads 12.91-13.26 m FLAT over ±80 m. The law lawfully cut
   13.19 -> 9.60 m, which sits above the real deck and reads as a fill.
   Sampling harder cannot fix it; only the vector corridor knows.

ARC R (owner ruling: the end envelope is law the SOLVER enforces)
 RESA cut admitted to the terrain graph as a one-sided interval edge.
 Measurement that settled it: the anchor is NOT the CIFP threshold, it is
 the pavement-EXIT elevation, and it MOVES — 212 reads, 106 numeric ones
 drifted median 0.110 / p90 0.150 / max 0.164 m, 88/106 over 0.05 m; the
 other 106 returned None pre-solve. Crown is the 0.15 m mode.
 Also fixed a REAL pre-existing bug: `_fair_ring_edges` faired cut rings
 and dragged a shared pavement node 2.1 m.
 ★ STOP CONDITION HIT AND RESOLVED: CYXY end 1 moved +1.68..+7.47 m —
   NOT coupling; a degenerate end whose outward march never exits pavement
   (`pavement_beyond_end` 297 m, governed 0). Lead added a no-pavement-exit
   guard: no exit ⇒ no end zone ⇒ no cut, matching the fill which already
   vanishes there by law.

OPT-1 (from the mandatory Fable-5 build-time review)
 `gap_fill._point_interval`/`_spine_interval`/`_freeze_spine_parent_specs`
 brute-force airside scans -> STRtree prefilter + hoisted exteriors +
 radius doubling. Byte-identical (6/6 empty diffs). HECA gap passes
 15.9 -> 2.4 s gate-off, 21.7 -> 3.0 s gate-on. The collar's marginal cost
 went +5.8 s -> +0.6 s, and the SHIPPED path gained 13.4 s at HECA.

## TEST STATE
Pre-flip baseline: 8 failed / 3170 passed / 36 skipped / 7 xfailed.
The 8 are long-standing: test_msfs_xplane_pack dsftool round-trip,
test_compare_target SPLP+SPJC, test_pavement_grade ×4, no_self_overlap[CYXY].
GATES-ON run: 16 failed. Lead has since fixed:
 * `ols_cut` added to `verification._NON_SOURCE_PAVEMENT_ROLES` (a new
   role must be enumerated at EVERY role-keyed site — it was wired into
   SOFT_RECEIVER_ROLES/AEROWAY_FOR_ROLE/ROLE_GRADE_LIMITS and not there).
 * `tests/test_terrain_role_admission.py` now drives from a complete
   `_SUBGATES` list + `test_subgate_list_is_complete` guard.
REMAINING gates-ON failure to fix: B2 above. **RE-RUN THE FULL SUITE** —
it has not been run since those fixes.
★ RESOLVED 2026-07-25 PM: full suite run TWICE through the ledger.
Pre-fix gates-ON baseline: 9 failed / 3172 passed (the 8 long-standing +
B2). Post-fix: **8 failed / 3196 passed / 34 skipped / 7 xfailed** — the
8 long-standing only; +21 new tests green, B2's envelope test green.

## QUEUED, NOT APPLIED
Fable ruling on `_fair_ring_edges._SKIP_ROLES` (full text in the session
transcript): ENDORSE the role-level skip — add ROLE_RUNWAY_CLEARANCE,
ROLE_GRADED_STRIP, ROLE_OLS_CUT to `_SKIP_ROLES`, KEEP the node-level
`skip_nodes` (they cover different classes), no gate. Measured 9 fairing
executions × 3 airports, 35,000+ candidate triples, ZERO accepted,
counterfactual delta 0.0 m on every node — a model correction, not a
behaviour fix. Landing protocol wants a byte-level A/B across CYXY, SPJC,
HECA, SPLP, KCLT, MMOX + one `O4_LEGACY_SURFACE_CLEARANCE=1` CYXY run;
**a diff anywhere is a live pavement-drag defect in HEAD, not a
regression of the change.** Not applied because the owner is mid-test.

## OTHER OPEN ITEMS
 * ★ RESOLVED 2026-07-25 PM: SPJC (76.97 s) + HECA (341.42 s) baselines
   recorded in tools/build_time_baselines.json (clean 2-run pairs, spreads
   0.7/0.6 s; checker PASS — SPJC under the existing 90 s approval
   ceiling). HECA's morning 409-487 s store records were contended junk.
 * ★ RESOLVED 2026-07-25 PM — OLS forced re-bake TRIANGLE CHECK run at
   tile -13-078 (SPJC+SPLP), O4_OLS_CUT A/B + byte-identical control:
   +146 tris tile-wide (+0.068 %), +168 in the SPJC bbox, all on the OLS
   fans, densest cells identical, no sliver/epsilon class. PASS — not a
   gate. Side effect: Tiles/zOrtho4XP_-13-078 + Patches are now a FRESH
   gates-on forced re-bake (the 08:17 artefacts predated the flip).
   Pre-flip mesh/patch preserved in the session scratchpad.
 * ★ OLS BUILD-TIME (HARD-LAW Fable-5 review, 2026-07-25 PM): an initial
   contended A/B suggested +7-8 s at SPJC — CONTAMINATED (the ON runs paid
   an ~8 s stale pavement-pack sidecar-cache rebuild the OFF run didn't,
   inside a 2-worker tile build). Clean interleaved fresh-interpreter A/B:
   OLS-on delta +0.2-0.5 s at SPJC (median 77.13 -> 77.56), ~0.0 at HECA
   (zero admitted penetrations — pre-scan exits in ms). UNDER the 0.6 s
   trigger; gate stays ON as shipped. Profile: 0.20 s in-pipeline, ~0.12 s
   of it rebuilding `clearance._surface_road_corridors` (built 3×/build —
   skirt ×2 + OLS ×1). QUEUED NEXT OPTIMIZATION ROUND: memoize the road
   corridor union per layout (~0.24 s back, OPT-1-class duplicate-work
   win). MEASUREMENT LESSON for the file: sidecar-cache staleness books
   ~8 s into "Assembling pavement" and reads as a feature regression —
   check the cache STALE/read log lines before attributing any phase-2
   delta.
 * SPJC builds are NOT run-to-run deterministic — two gates-off builds in
   one session, same DEM state, gave 906 vs 911 shapes and moved a finding
   0.115 m. Any cross-build A/B needs a control build. This undermines
   several of this round's A/B deltas.
 * `driver.py` calls `verify_and_log(source_runways=None)`; the lead added
   `layout.apt_runways` + a fallback so the caps mirror measures the real
   centreline. Threading `source_runways` properly is still cleaner.
 * Emitter snapshots gates into module locals at import
   (`AG._END_PIN` etc.) while the validator reads config at call time —
   equivalent in production, but a test must flip BOTH. Worth unifying.
 * `emit_decimate` collinear-span split: two independent sessions produced
   fixes. The MAIN-tree one (split at the arc-length MIDPOINT) was kept
   and the greedy worktree one REMOVED, because greedy-from-one-end is not
   orientation-independent: on a span whose length does not divide evenly
   it keeps 7 nodes but two abutting rings tracing it in opposite
   directions disagree, and the unanimity vote keeps the UNION — 24 nodes
   vs the midpoint version's 18, plus broken chain identity.

## GATE STATE (all six flipped ON 2026-07-25 by owner ruling)
 O4_RUNWAY_END_RESA, O4_ADJACENT_GROUND_END_PIN,
 O4_STRIP_WIDTH_FROM_CENTERLINE, O4_POCKET_COLLAR_RINGS, O4_OLS_CUT,
 O4_ONE_SOLVE_TERRAIN_RUNWAY_END_RESA.
 Every arc was proven byte-identical gate-off at landing, so setting any
 ONE env var to 0 isolates that arc cleanly.
 + SEVENTH GATE added 2026-07-25 PM: O4_CONFORMANCE_CUT_CLAMP (B2 fix,
 default ON, off ⇒ byte-identical pre-fix weld). The B1 fix carries NO
 gate of its own — O4_POCKET_COLLAR_RINGS=0 removes the collar AND the
 zone together (byte-identical bands).
 DELIBERATELY OFF: O4_GAP_FILL_INTERIOR_FLOOR (owner ruling, above).

## BUILD ARTEFACTS
 ★★ CURRENT: App 1.0.200 / engine 1.50.1640 at
 dist.nosync/XPTerrainBuilder.app — the ROUND IS COMMITTED (3cdc8a3 on
 main, 45 files) plus the three chip fixes: conformance insert dedupe
 (_radius_index, was already swept into 3cdc8a3 — the chip edited the
 main checkout), the _resolve_yielding_tjunctions/_resolve_edge_crossings
 dedupe guards (same), and the _surface_road_corridors per-layout memo
 (merge 1b117a0 — all 4 call sites incl. OLS hit the cache, ~0.24 s/
 airport back). Post-merge suite: 8 failed / 3202 passed (the 8
 long-standing only). Freshness VERIFIED (auto_patch.ols in the frozen
 module table, engine version bumped) + direct-exec launch OK. All gates
 at defaults (the O4_POCKET_COLLAR_RINGS=0 workaround is OBSOLETE).
 (Prior stamp: 1.0.199 / 1.50.1639, uncommitted-tree build, superseded.)
 (Superseded stamp for the record: 1.0.198 / 1.50.1638 predated the
 fixes. Rebuild procedure, unchanged:)
   scripts/make_engine.sh   (redirect, NEVER pipe — pipefail + an early
                             closing pipe kills it silently at exit 141)
   scripts/make_app.sh release
 Verify freshness: `auto_patch.ols` must appear in the frozen module table
 (`strings`/`grep -a` the Engine binary). A plain grep of the bundle for
 source symbols proves NOTHING — the modules are in a compressed archive;
 a control with pre-existing symbols comes back absent too.
 macOS: direct-exec Contents/MacOS/XPTerrainBuilder first — the first
 `open` of a fresh bundle can hang in LaunchServices.

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 20260718 PM — ≤60 s PROGRAM RETROSPECTIVE + TRACK BOARD OPENED
# docs/build_time_program_board.md = cross-session continuation point
# (measured state, 4-audit retrospective condensed, track table T0-T7,
# verification discipline).  Headlines: ★store UNDERCOUNTS ~40 s
# (record_build before late FGP — fix in flight, chip session; OTHH
# true ≈382 s); ★late FGP defers ~nothing because snapshot never
# recaptured post-mid (T1a in flight); ★wave-2c coloring recomputed
# 9-12×/build + quadratic at hubs, ~32 s overhead (T2a in flight,
# byte-identical); ★wave 3 = 1 lever of 4 at 1 site, Θ(n²) intact
# (T3a in flight); ★Tier 2 structurally NEVER fires at OTHH → owner
# ruling needed (T7); ★remaining planned work alone lands 150-180 s,
# NOT 60 — T4 pair-generation collapse + T5 never-planned emitters
# required.  Profiler phase-boundary drift fixed (b1315e0).
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 20260718 — BUILD-TIME BASELINES REFRESHED POST WAVES 2c+3
# tools/build_time_baselines.json re-measured at dev 0834fef (includes
# projection-wave2c + geometry-wave3 merges): CYXY 40.6 s (was 43.4),
# OTHH 343.4 s (was 365.8).  Cold-equivalent per the checker docstring:
# one warm-up full build per airport, then fresh-interpreter measured
# run via check_build_time.py --run --update-baselines.  Preconditions
# verified (no concurrent builds; OSM regional extracts + Elevation_data
# present).  tests/test_check_build_time.py 27 green; standalone
# check_build_time.py PASS.  OTHH remains over the 60 s airport budget
# (approvals file still empty — pre-existing state, improved this round).
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 20260718 EARLY AM — TWO SUPERVISED AGENT LANDINGS INTEGRATED
# (same session as the EGGW tunnel fixes below; all uncommitted):
# 1. RIGID-SEAT SPAN LIMIT (EGGW floating buildings FIXED):
#    DSF_OBJECT_BAKE_MAX_GROUND_SPAN_M=3.0 — a Phase-2 structure whose
#    ground span exceeds it (and has no anchored feet) is LEFT AT
#    AUTHORED ELEVATIONS (skip_reason "…rigid-seat limit…"); its
#    buildings ride their Phase-1 pads.  ★Stale-bake restore already
#    existed (object_rebake reversion pass un-bakes undecided
#    resources vs .anchor_bak) — skips route through it.  EGGW: both
#    mega components skip; EGLL: only 4 new skips, all >3 m.  LEAD
#    RULINGS: A3 bake-and-flag SUPERSEDED (test renamed/flipped);
#    KCLT end-to-end allows span-reason skips (3/220, spans
#    3.46-4.22 m — USER: spot-check KCLT terminal in-sim).
#    tests/test_object_bake_span_limit.py (7) + object suite 183 green.
# 2. FEATURE A TUNNEL CARVES (W-T) BUILT — GATE DEFAULTED **ON**
#    (user ruling 2026-07-18; also ruled: trench depth authority =
#    the OBJECT'S OWN GEOMETRY, author mesh was oracle-only).  230
#    object tests + compare-target green at ON; ★rebuild +43-080
#    with O4_AUTO_PATCH_REBUILD=1 to get the CYYZ cut (freshness
#    gate ignores code changes).  Chips running in cloud sessions:
#    node_altitudes loss root-cause; flat-fast-path refusal role.
#    (O4_OBJECT_TUNNEL_TERRAIN): whole-body trench pans (A1) + rim
#    collars born at layout from classification.tunnels; pavement wins
#    (R2/R8, yielded area logged); ROLE_TUNNEL_TRENCH = LAW weld tier
#    + decimation exemption + force_per_node.  ★MEASURED DEVIATION
#    FROM R12 (lead-accepted): trench pins must NOT join solver
#    PAVEMENT_ROLES — coupling dragged 30% of EGLL airside pavement
#    down (max 8.3 m); shipped decoupled (pavement neutrality 0.004 m
#    mean).  EGLL oracle: substantial tunnels within ~±1 m of the
#    author mesh (−0.5 m by design); tunnel 5 under pavement → not cut;
#    9/12 shallow (OBJECT under-specifies author — open Q1).  EGGW
#    byte-neutral.  CYYZ: taxiway tunnels = Feature-B BRIDGES; one
#    Feature-A cut (Terminal-1, 2.46 m = expected).  BEFORE DEFAULT-ON:
#    rule open Q1 (object-vs-author depth); verification.py lockstep
#    validator; rule enclosed-terminal parts (A vs C/R10);
#    ROLE_TUNNEL_TRENCH into flat_airport_fast_path refusal roles.
#    tests/test_object_tunnel_terrain.py (15).
# ALSO: EGWN int64 solver fix cherry-picked (d89b155c, user's cloud
# session).  ★Pre-existing red: test_contracts::
# test_object_geometry_fields (another session's draped_layer_group
# field in obj8_reader — not ours).
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 20260717 EVENING — EGGW TUNNEL FIXES (separate session; BUILT +
# mesh-verified at EGGW, uncommitted):
# 1. `unclassified` added to HW_TUNNEL_TYPES (bridges.py) — EGGW's
#    airside tunnel (ways -232502/-22713, highway=unclassified
#    tunnel=yes) was invisible while service/residential qualified.
#    ★_load_tunnel_road_network ALREADY merges small_roads (KPHL);
#    the class filter was the real gate, and mapped unclassified
#    tunnels keep their MAPPED ends (re-split set = major classes).
# 2. DEM-CUT PORTAL MODE (user ruling: what a tunnel ramp needs
#    DEPENDS ON THE MESH): with a lidar inset the bare-earth DTM
#    already carves the approach ramps AND strips the structure over
#    the bore (open trench under the taxiway).  Detection = median
#    CROSS-ROAD relief (deck beside the walk minus walk) ≥ 3 m over
#    the first 60 m — ★never absolute-vs-apt_elev (its mid-field
#    fallback samples the trench floor itself: measured apt_elev ==
#    cut_min at EGGW) and ★never DEM-vs-surroundings (false-fires on
#    hillside bores, KPHL class).  Cut mode emits ONLY: flat cap at
#    the measured cross-road deck grade, 6 m mouth plate at the DEM's
#    own road grade (crisp face wall), and a GRADED roof-quad chain
#    (4-corner sloped rects, ramp-chain corner convention) from
#    face-top grade up to the pavement-seam deck — NO synthetic
#    ramps/walls/throat ("no tunnel ramp around the parking garage").
#    Flat-DEM airports keep the legacy path byte-identically; env
#    gate O4_TUNNEL_DEM_CUT.  ★★Post-solve plates: way-level altitude
#    and 4-corner altitude_high/low reach the mesh; per-vertex
#    node_altitudes measurably LOSE most values en route to the
#    written patch (mechanism un-root-caused — chip spawned; owner
#    prefers per-corner once fixed).  ★Roof chains truncate at the
#    bore MIDPOINT (a full-bore plate put the partner cluster inside
#    "an emitted portal's exclusion zone" — silent drop), emit ONLY
#    from the clear-line piece CONTAINING the member's own face
#    (nearest-piece fallback wandered onto the taxiway mid-body),
#    and the mouth plate = cluster rect MINUS the roof union (roof
#    wins in the twin-carriageway stagger zone).
# 3. PORTAL-FACE records (object_terrain_features.py): single-
#    placement all-SOFT ≤8-tri quads hanging below grade (min y ≤ −2,
#    top ≤ +1, height ≥ 2, rect long side 4-60 m) = the EGGW portal
#    authoring class; finds EXACTLY the 2 real portals in 614 pack
#    objects.  ★A face is NOT ⊥ to the tunnel axis (parallels the
#    crossed taxiway edge) — face pairs test mutual parallelism +
#    segment-crosses-face.  Faces join R4 exclusions always (the
#    y-bake would shove a hanging face up by its height).  Pairs
#    corroborated by a mapped OSM tunnel are SUPPRESSED (OSM owns —
#    fires at EGGW); object-only pairs ride the KBNA portal branch
#    with the ANCHOR-SEAT INVERSION (anchor disk joins the deck-grade
#    crown, never the road-grade mouth).  Cache bumps:
#    _CLASSIFICATION_CACHE_VERSION 3→4, _OBJECT_FOOTPRINT_CACHE 1→2.
# 4. Tests: tests/test_tunnel_dem_cut_portals.py +

#    Tiles/ dir — ★run_tile_mesh_only builds into Tiles/, the user's
#    flyable scenery lives on ThunderBlade): tunnel body graded

# 20260717-18 OBJ8 GROUND-PAINT PAVEMENT (separate session — feature
# BUILT; OWNER RULED 2026-07-18: DEFAULT ON for in-sim testing.
# HECA builds now gain +4.05 km2 pavement — expect
# test_pavement_grade[HECA] failure content to shift (pre-existing
# red either way) and HECA compare-target drift until fixtures are
# re-cut after the in-sim verdict):
# Packs like HECA Tai Models draw base pavement as DRAPED-ONLY .obj
# texture pages (asphalt.obj = 31k draped vertices, zero solid tris)
# invisible to both the building path and the .pol pavement reader.
# NEW: obj8_reader parses ATTR_layer_group_draped;
# dsf_reader.read_dsf_object_pavements admits draped-only objects
# declaring layer group runways/taxiways at offset ≤1 (base pavement
# stacks UNDER markings — the pack's own rendering contract is the
# base-vs-decal discriminator), unions their draped triangles into
# patches (all patches, holes honoured), chains them through the ONE
# existing DSF pavement sweep (same gates, third-party marked),
# sidecar-cached (o4_object_pavements_*).  24 tests
# (test_dsf_object_pavement.py) green.  Gate O4_DSF_OBJECT_PAVEMENT
# **DEFAULT OFF pending owner ruling** — suite untouched at OFF.
# HECA law-true A/B (axes-sidecar check_grade): +4.05 km² pavement,
# within-shape 30→3 (fixes 27/30 tracked frontage flags!) BUT
# test_runway_longitudinal_grade[HECA] GREEN→RED (the one genuine
# new regression, un-root-caused; 3 runway-end-skirt violations at
# the low end are the lead), TEAR 0→6, CROSS 0→3, mid-edge 0→55,
# retaining walls 21→332 (perimeter sheets over desert relief).
# OWNER RULED: NO airside/groundside split — object pavement rides
# the same union/slicing as .pol pavement, existing perimeter
# treatment stands.  LONGITUDINAL REGRESSION ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED:
# MID final_grade_projection writeback aliasing — the runway's
# beyond-threshold blast-pad corner (hard 57.56 through the whole
# solve, probed clean) aliases via get_or_add on post-densify
# geometry to the new terrain-pressed junction's soft node and gets
# stamped 55.31 (1.8% end kink); later passes re-seed the corruption
# as hard truth and the LATE run's RUNWAY PROFILE PRESERVE restores
# it verbatim.  FIX = the preserve snapshot/restore made
# UNCONDITIONAL in final_grade_projection (was late-run-only) —
# runway nodes are hard through the projection by design, so the
# only writeback-changeable runway values are aliasing corruptions.
# VERIFIED: gate-ON longitudinal[HECA] RED→GREEN; gate-OFF
# longitudinal[HECA/SPJC/CYXY] all stay GREEN (baseline undisturbed).  ★PROCESS: check_grade CLI
# without <patch>.osm.axes.json (written only at O4_LOG_VERBOSITY>0)
# over-flags 17,092-vs-3 on the same patch — never read grade
# numbers off a sidecar-less run.  ★DEBUG: coordinate-keyed
# class-level BuiltShape.__setattr__ watchpoint with stack capture =
# the tool that found the writer (index-keyed and single-object
# watches both false-negatived).
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 20260717 NIGHT ADDENDUM (after the wave-2 section below; three
# further landings, all verified):
# 1. 05L/23R KINK FIX (late-projection WRITEBACK ALIASING): two runway
#    ring vertices under the 0.5 m canonical tolerance alias to ONE
#    grade-graph node; the late projection holds it hard but its
#    _writeback re-stamps BOTH ring vertices with the one value
#    (60.46→60.70, a 3.7% profile kink at HECA).  Fix = RUNWAY PROFILE
#    PRESERVE (solve.py): late run snapshots runway/runway_crossing
#    altitude fields pre-projection, restores post-writeback.  HECA
#    longitudinal test GREEN; SPJC all-zero.  ★WATCH: the same
#    writeback aliasing exposure exists for ANY sub-tolerance vertex
#    pair on any shape in the late run — fixture airports empirically
#    clean, runway was the datum-critical case.
# 2. OBJ8 MEGA-PAD FIX (user in-sim reports EGGW/EGLL/HECA — giant
#    building pads + buried EGLL tunnels):  co-baked packs' connector
#    meshes (2.7 km fence, road/rail, NEN ground slabs) chain real
#    buildings into airport-scale components at the contact-epsilon
#    partition; convex hull fills the field.  OSM extracts REFUTED as
#    cause (sane data, DSF-preferred wins).  SHIPPED:
#    DSF_OBJECT_MAX_FOOTPRINT_AREA_M2 default 0→100000 (area backstop)
#    + sidecar-cache fingerprint now includes the gate constants (was
#    silently serving stale geometry).  EGGW 10→39 buildings, EGLL
#    tunnels un-buried, HECA 1.94M m² pad gone (338→487 buildings),
#    SPJC's own 371k LIMANUEVA mega dropped (55→65 seeds, grades 0).
#    IMPLEMENTED BUT DEFAULT-OFF pending owner ruling: connector
#    pre-filter (span 300/fill 0.20 — texture-page .obj packs defeat
#    the fill heuristic: EGGW 39→6) and structure span gate (500 m —
#    kills SPJC's real 560 m banner-inflated terminal).  Residual
#    sub-backstop spanners: EGLL 88k/1076 m + 87k/654 m, HECA
#    46k/601 m.  OWNER RULED 2026-07-17: option (b) ACCEPTED — ship
#    the backstop alone; fill-aware span gate = designed follow-up.  321 object-pipeline tests green.
# 3. HECA within-shape rose 14→30 WITH the object fix — NOT a
#    regression: 149 newly-revealed real building pads carry the known
#    frontage-flag class (terminal-8); TEAR/CROSS/steps stay 0.
# 4. Compare-target fixtures RE-CUT a second time same day (after the
#    object fix; SPJC building 57→60, total 775; SPLP tiles
#    unchanged); floors updated in test_compare_target.py.
# 5. FINAL SWEEP RESULT (six suites × four airports, -n0,
#    PYTHONHASHSEED=0): ONE red left — test_pavement_grade[HECA]
#    (terminal-8 apron-bridged-terminal class, ~30 building frontage
#    flags after the object fix revealed 149 real pads; TEAR/CROSS/
#    steps 0).  Everything else GREEN or tracked: compare-target green
#    on the fresh fixtures, SPLP route-band XPASS→now gates hard,
#    CYXY building19 floor re-pinned 697.7 (user in-sim acceptance),
#    CYXY route-reach converted to tracked xfail (user acceptance —
#    2.42%/2.12%/1.69% feeder-convergence residuals, sub-visible).
#    USER RULINGS 2026-07-17 recorded: span-gate option (b) accepted;
#    CYXY accepted as-is; user reviewing HECA/SPJC/SPLP in-sim next.
# 6. EGLL TUNNEL-PAD EXCLUSION (user in-sim: "building36" bulging
#    south over two tunnel objects): the pad WAS a pure tunnel
#    (shell+deck pair welded correctly, mis-emitted as a building).
#    Fix: the Feature-B classifier (object_terrain_features, pure
#    placements+geometry) now runs at building-extraction time in
#    dsf_reader.read_dsf_object_buildings; classified tunnel/bridge/
#    deck resources are dropped pre-pooling (gate OBJECT_BRIDGE_
#    TERRAIN, failure-safe fallback, cache-fingerprinted).  EGLL
#    tunnel pads 10→0 — INCLUDING both ruling-(b) residual spanners
#    (they were tunnels); EGGW 39 / HECA 487 exact; SPJC all-zero;
#    391 object tests green (+2 new).  Only residual spanner left
#    anywhere: HECA 46k/601 m.
# 7. WHOLE-SUITE REGRESSION: 2058 passed / 10 failed — 1 = the known
#    HECA terminal-8 red; 9 are the CONCURRENT session's in-flight
#    areas (6 build-time estimates, 2 texture modes, 1 provider
#    registry custom_url; plus their obj8_reader draped_layer_group
#    breaks test_contracts::test_object_geometry_fields).  Zero
#    regressions from this session's work.
#    NEXT SESSION CANDIDATES: terminal-8 solver project (THE red),
#    fill-aware span gate (only HECA's 46k/601 m spanner left),
#    solved_store_missing_shape root-cause, writeback-aliasing watch
#    item.

# written explanation + EXPLICIT owner approval.  Binds all sessions.
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 20260717 LIVE BUILD QUEUE + DYNAMIC ORCHESTRATOR RESOURCES (working
# tree, uncommitted; separate feature from the auto_patch wave below).
# WHAT LANDED (unit-tested, NOT yet live-verified with a real build):
# 1. QUEUE WHILE BUILDING.  The map is never locked during a run
#    (set_locked calls removed from O4_Qt_GUI); right panel is now
#    THREE boxes: Selection (the old "Tile" box, renamed), Build
#    (options always visible; button relabels "＋ Queue N tiles"
#    mid-run), Activity (per-tile progress rows + elapsed/remaining +
#    Stop; hidden when idle).  Clicking Build during a run appends the
#    batch to it (rows append, no re-zoom, no console toggle); tiles
#    already queued/building are skipped; install toggle now gates
#    per-tile (only tiles live in the run), not globally.
# 2. ENGINE: EngineSession.enqueue_build(...) is the single view entry
#    — starts a run when idle, appends to the live one otherwise, in
#    BOTH run modes.  Batches keep their own provider/ZL/output-dir/
#    step selection: ParallelBuildRun is now per-tile throughout
#    (_tile_arguments/_programs/_static_windows replace the run-wide
#    _program/_build_arguments — unit tests that poked _program were
#    updated).  In-process worker consumes a lock-guarded work deque
#    (same lock decides run-end, so an enqueue can never land into a
#    run that just chose to finish).  RunDone is emitted BEFORE child
#    reaping in _maybe_finish so a Build click at run-end starts
#    fresh immediately (enqueue_build has a 2 s settle wait for the
#    finishing race).  jsonl: additive "enqueue_build" command.
# 3. RESOURCES — OWNER RULING (20260717, supersedes the sibling-
#    division work built earlier the same day): MACHINE resources are
#    the OPERATING SYSTEM's to arbitrate (user historically ran six
#    hand-launched Ortho4XP copies + X-Plane fine).  Per-tile pools
#    now run FULL WIDTH regardless of concurrent tiles: convert Auto =
#    cores-2 (no sibling division), download Auto = 2 always (the
#    1-when-siblings rule removed — this was the 17-min-half-rate
#    case), masks back to the plain module constant, orchestrator
#    compute class UNCAPPED (was slots-1).  The mid-step "raiser"
#    machinery in download_textures/build_tile was therefore DELETED
#    (nothing left to raise).  Deliberate throttles remain ONLY where
#    the OS cannot help: osm/imagery class caps (2 each — remote
#    server goodwill, Overpass ban history) and the mesh MEMORY
#    admission gate (an 18 GB 1-m raster ×2 + X-Plane is the one real
#    cliff).  Sibling broadcast machinery kept: its one remaining
#    consumer is the bathymetry cell fetch (small remote hosts).
#    ★Sibling broadcast holders-only fix retained (was holders+queue).
# TESTS: tests/test_qt_activity_queue.py NEW (3-box panel, queue
#    path, unlocked map); enqueue coverage in test_engine_parallel
#    (subprocess mid-run join, duplicate refusal, in-process append)
#    + test_parallel_coordination (per-batch args, holders-based
#    siblings) + mask-slot sharing in test_parallel_slots.
# 4. LIVE-RUN FIXES (user-reported 20260717): ★pool was created at
#    min(slots, initial batch) — a 2-tile run on a 4-slot machine
#    pinned every enqueued tile behind the original pair; the run now
#    takes the FULL configured slots and start() spawns only
#    min(slots, queue) children (enqueue grows the pool on demand).
#    Single-tile starts now use the orchestrator too (slots>1 ⇒
#    subprocess even for one tile) so later enqueues run concurrently;
#    ★worker children stay in-process via the steps-set gate PLUS an
#    explicit slots=1 in every child step command (a child must never
#    orchestrate grandchildren — jsonl tests resolve Auto slots to 1
#    only because the stub O4_Config_Utils lacks max_build_slots).
#    ★Activity box stopped growing with the window: the idle bottom
#    spacer kept its stretch share — _set_activity_box_visible zeroes
#    it while the box shows, restores it on hide.
# 5. LIVE "BUILD APPEARS HUNG" (20260717) DIAGNOSED + FIXED: workers
#    were fine (100% core each, progressing); the FRONT-END process
#    sat at 100% for 20+ min inside pyosmium parsing
#    great-britain.osm.pbf (2.1 GB) — the parallel-run OSM cache
#    WARMER now routes through the regional-extract backend, i.e.
#    multi-pass country pbf scans IN the GUI process, starving the
#    interface via the interpreter lock.  FIX: new
#    O4_OSM_Extracts.local_extracts_cover(bbox); the warmer skips
#    tiles fully covered by stored extracts (no Overpass to spare —
#    the worker child filters the same extracts in its own process).
#    Warming remains for Overpass-served tiles.  This is the
#    materialized "★perf follow-up = per-tile sub-extract if 3-pass
#    country scans slow" risk from osm_regional_extracts — the
#    sub-extract optimization is still worth doing for the CHILDREN.
# 6. POISONED EXTRACT ("error reading the PBF", live 20260717):
#    Geofabrik's index lists regions with no published extract; their
#    download address answers an HTML page under HTTP 200, which
#    _download_extract stored verbatim (enfield.osm.pbf, 9.6 KB HTML)
#    — the filter then errored on it on every request (non-fatal:
#    Overpass fallback, build continued).  FIX: pbf content probe
#    (b"OSMHeader" in first 64 bytes — sits at byte 6 of the header
#    blob): _download_extract rejects non-pbf payloads (never
#    installed), and _stored_regions_missing deletes poisoned store
#    files on sight, treating them as missing (Overpass serves; a
#    later published extract self-heals via the wanted list).  The
#    live store was audited: enfield deleted, all 19 others genuine.
#    ★BSD grep can't do this probe (NUL bytes) — the audit must use
#    Python, not `head|grep`.
# 7. SPEC WRITTEN docs/specs/flat-airport-fast-path-spec.md (owner
#    directive after OTHH 660 s): 3 tiers on top of the EXISTING
#    O4_FLAT_SHAPE_LAZY certificate tier — T1 coverage (rects, seats
#    incl. reach-band skip, groundside), T2 whole-airport solve
#    collapse (O4_FLAT_AIRPORT_FAST_PATH), T3 mixed-airport narrowing
#    (DEFERRED — collides with drive-to-zero projection files).
#    WP1+WP2 LANDED (Opus agents, lead-verified; working tree):
#    T1 coverage (rect/seat certificates + counters, 20 tests) and T2
#    whole-airport fast path (flat_airport_fast_path.py + ONE early
#    branch in solve.py, O4_FLAT_AIRPORT_FAST_PATH default on).
#    MEASURED (OTHH warm): baseline 887 s profile — reach bands
#    dominate (band 271 s, visible-centerline 253 s, accept-flags
#    234 s, node_bands 163 s); T1 gate-on 505 s vs all-off 567 s;
#    check_grade identical both sides.  ★HONEST FINDING: NO fixture
#    airport fires the whole-airport certificate — OTHH refuses
#    (crossing-terrain zone + real relief: 82/186 aprons, 157/648
#    junctions, 38/89 seats refuse; baseline OTHH check_grade = 215
#    within-shape >1.5% — OTHH is NOT actually flat and its output
#    is not drive-to-zero clean); HECA/CYXY refuse on gap-fill
#    spines.  ⇒ the big win needs TIER 3 (regional narrowing:
#    per-region reach-band skip, EXCLUDE crossing-claimed geometry
#    instead of refusing the airport) — deferred until the
#    drive-to-zero/OBJ-pavement session settles (shared files).
#    Overpass→extract mid-wait switch also LANDED + verified
#    (get_overpass_data alternative_source hook, 43 tests green).
#    ★origin/claude/inspiring-gauss-4mnpm9 FETCHED (2 fixes: int64
#    accumulator crash in one_solve._project_vectorized on
#    all-interval graphs + headless-tools grouped-mode on per-tile
#    build dirs).  CHERRY-PICKED into flat-fast-path-tier3
#    (4528ec3, d89b155; tests green).  NOT applied to this shared
#    dev tree (one_solve.py carries live in-flight edits) — dev
#    sessions: take it when convenient or it arrives at merge-back.
#    ★TIER3 WAVE OUTCOMES (branch HEAD bb1c194): wave1 REFUTED
#    clamp-only band premise (conservative intervals shift fixpoint;
#    prohibited); wave2a raster reach-band field: band machinery 61×,
#    OTHH 524→370 s, HECA all 1037 pinned infeasibilities gone — but
#    wave2b f2d9ddf: raster band DEFAULT ON, tears 0 (emit-pass heal
#    + cross-strip coordinate-twin, both raster-gated); SPJC +23 =
#    grid residual, tolerance constant 0.25 m documented; OTHH
#    gate-on 376.6 s.  NEXT: chromatic GS + chains, wave 3
#    geometry/emit, then branch→dev merge (lead job).
#    ★20260718 MERGED TO DEV: 7 tier-3 commits cherry-picked
#    (bbad95c..198394b, raster band ON); whole-branch merge rejected
#    (snapshot pollution); 41 hermetic tests green on dev.  ★INCIDENT:
#    tracked data-dir symlinks in one pick MATERIALIZED over the real
#    ignored dirs — OSM_data/Elevation_data/Airport_mod_cache LOST +
#    RESTORED (20 extracts 6.6 GB re-downloaded, 0 invalid; DEM/mod
#    caches regenerate lazily).  RULE: never track symlinks at data
#    paths; audit incoming commits before checkout-class ops.
#    ★ACTIVE BRANCHES (all forked from dev 198394b, plain-merge back):
#    projection-wave2c (../Ortho4XP-wave2c: chromatic GS + chains),
#    geometry-wave3 (../Ortho4XP-wave3: vectorized geometry/emit,
#    byte-identity), inset-performance (../Ortho4XP-inset: inset
#    inpaint profiling/optimization).  Old tier3 worktree RETIRED.
#    ★(historical) TIER 3 HOME was git worktree Ortho4XP-tier3, branch
#    flat-fast-path-tier3, baseline 92488bf = frozen snapshot of this
#    tree 20260717 evening (owner ruling: build Tier 3 on a stable
#    base, unaffected by parallel-session churn).  Data dirs
#    symlinked; uses the MAIN venv; module resolution verified to the
#    worktree.  Commits allowed ON THAT BRANCH ONLY.  Merge back to
#    dev after Tier 3 acceptance; expect conflicts in
#    solver_primitives/building_feasibility/solve.py with whatever
#    dev accumulated meanwhile — merge is a lead-session job.
# FOLLOW-UPS: live-verify a 4-slot run + mid-run queue add; the
#    Activity box keeps run history only until 5 s after RunDone;
#    docs/specs/parallel-tile-builds.md not yet updated for §3.7
#    sibling formula change / enqueue / §3.1 single-tile-runs-
#    subprocess change (spec edit pending).
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 20260717 EVENING SESSION — DRIVE-TO-ZERO WAVE 2 LANDED (working
# tree, all uncommitted; shared-tree rules unchanged: never
# stash/revert shared files).  STATE AT HANDOVER (full_airport_build,
# PYTHONHASHSEED=0, check_grade on the emitted OSM):
#   SPJC  ALL GREEN (within 0, tear 0, cross 0, steps 0)
#   CYXY  confirmation build pending this session's last fixes; was
#         ALL GREEN at the lockstep milestone (within 12→0, tear 0)
#   SPLP  ALL GREEN at baseline; confirmation build pending
#   HECA  within 25→14 (ALL buildings — the pre-existing terminal-8
#         "apron-bridged terminals" class; test docstring already
#         tracks it RED pending T8 solver work), everything else 0
# WHAT LANDED (all verified by unit tests + airport builds):
# 1. DONOR GATE on adjacent_ground's vertex_value_registry (the THIRD
#    foreign-value writer, missed on 20260717 AM): unconditional
#    authority adoption now requires WELD_DONOR_ROLES membership
#    (donor_value_keys); non-donor authority corners (service_road,
#    buildings…) weld only when values agree.  Killed the surviving
#    CYXY #518 strip tear (service-road 709.5 spliced into a 705.7
#    band).  value_changing_adoptions 272→196.
# 2. Band-tear heal kept as the agent's DROP version (field-proven);
#    the footprint-equality admission test now neutralizes the heal
#    via monkeypatch (it guards the CONSTRUCT move; the heal is
#    value-dependent by design).  94/94 adjacent_ground tests green.
# 3. HEAL RE-DECONFLICT: healed pieces re-subtract nearby prior
#    bands/static footprints (the heal's vertex drop could swing the
#    closing edge into a sibling → the 0.22 m² CYXY band∩band
#    overlap).  With identity-gated value remap (difference() can
#    shift vertices at equal count → positional alts misalign;
#    measured SPJC 1.1 m in-band tear, now fixed): unchanged vertices
#    keep their healed value (1 cm gate), minted vertices take
#    resample_alt.  test_no_self_overlap[CYXY] overlap 1→0 in replay.
# 4. LOCKSTEP PAIR-CAPS (the last non-lockstep reader closed): the
#    final projection freezes its enforced per-pair metre budgets
#    (verification.lockstep_pair_caps_ll, via _lockstep_shape_bake →
#    canonical points → lat/lon); to_osm exports sidecar "pair_caps";
#    check_grade's SOFT-role branch consumes exactly those pairs
#    (cap floored at flat, + quant noise) instead of re-baking from
#    the emitted ring (post-projection inserts tightened re-baked
#    spans below what the solver enforced: 11 of CYXY's 12 flags were
#    0.03-0.20 m over the FINAL-ring caps yet inside the enforced
#    ones; the 12th was a pair the law-side bake never selected).
#    test_pavement_grade passes pair_caps_ll from the layout attr.
# 5. LATE FINAL PROJECTION (pipeline end, gate
#    O4_FINAL_PROJECTION_LATE default 1): re-runs
#    final_grade_projection after band/gap emission + conformance +
#    densify — the mid call is no longer last and the truly-final
#    rings drifted (SPJC's last 2 within-shape pairs = building36
#    seat vs junction level, unsatisfiable in the mid graph,
#    closed by the post-insert graph).  Safety rails added:
#    broken-quarantine CARRY (_final_projection_broken_keys →
#    pre_broken; un-carried pockets smear ~1 m moves) and EMITTED
#    TERRAIN-BAND FREEZE (band-exclusive ring nodes hard; zone
#    vertices are solver variables with no neighbour coupling — an
#    unfrozen re-projection moved one 1.1 m and minted a tear.
#    Weld-row nodes shared with pavement stay FREE; to_osm authority
#    consensus reconciles).  Also O4_FINAL_PROJECTION_MAX_ITERS
#    (default 2400, was 400 — HECA plateaus at 5822 over-cap edges
#    regardless; that plateau IS the T8-class infeasible subsystem).
# 6. ROUTE-BAND runway-datum exemption (grade_graph_validate):
#    value-gated — a vertex grading at cap from a nearby runway ring
#    vertex's de-crowned value (15 m radius) is the runway datum, not
#    band-judged (SPJC 16L/34R: 4 hard seed_rwy_seam junction
#    vertices + 1 interpolated between them, 0.10-0.38 m "excess"
#    vs a ceiling computed only from centerline-join anchors).
#    SPJC route-band 5→0 expected (probe: 5→1→0 across the two
#    iterations); anti-gaming tests still pass.
# REMAINING TO ZERO:
# 1. HECA 14 building within-shape (terminal-8 class, see above) —

# 20260717 NEW IN-SIM REPORT (user, end of session): HECA REBUILT,
# HAS ISSUES — user suspects the new 30 m inset elevation data
# processing (the elevation-inset margin/cache-invalidation work from
# today's OTHER session — see memory inset_margin_cache_invalidation).
# TWO CAVEATS for whoever investigates:
# 1. The rebuild ran from THIS working tree, which carries ALL of
#    today's uncommitted auto_patch changes (HECA is directly touched
#    by: the crown end-taper fix in crown.py, the band-tear healing +
#    building standoff in adjacent_ground.py, the groundside
#    building-containment fixes, the pair-law/lockstep changes) — AND
#    fix agents were actively editing while builds may have run.  A
#    mid-edit build can be a stale-module mix.  FIRST STEP: rebuild
#    the HECA patch reproducibly from the settled tree
#    (PYTHONHASHSEED=0) and re-check before attributing anything.
# 2. Candidate split: the 30 m inset = the GLO-30 building-masked
#    inset (memory copernicus_glo30_building_masked_inset: OSM-
#    footprint mask + INPAINT, live-verified HECA today) — inpainted
#    surface artifacts / margin / cache-keying vs auto_patch grading
#    changes.  Discriminate
#    with the DEM first: compare the inset raster at the issue
#    coordinates against the previous build's (the inset cache
#    invalidation work changed cache keying TODAY); a wrong DEM
#    explains terrain issues without any auto_patch involvement.
# NEED FROM USER: issue coordinates / screenshots + which issues
# (terrain vs pavement vs objects), and roughly when the rebuild ran.

# 20260718 PER-VERTEX node_altitudes EMIT LOSS ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED
# (session: emit-per-vertex; the EGGW +51-001 tunnel-plate collapse
# measured 2026-07-17).  MECHANISM (all in layout.to_osm): the
# nid-level final weld inserts partner-way nodes into a value-carrying
# ring; a node whose first-writer way interned it WITHOUT an altitude
# claim (no altitude model, or a misaligned node_altitudes list the
# old ``len(elevs) >= len(coords)`` guard silently dropped — including
# the value-keyed closing-repeat trim mis-cutting an OPEN [H,L,L,H]
# list, H==H) has no consensus; ONE such node failed ``have_all`` and
# the fallback had NO node_altitudes branch, so the whole way shipped
# with alt_abs only on vertices OTHER ways claimed (EGGW roofs: 2-3 of
# 6-7) and the mesh dropped the rest onto raw DEM.  The hi/lo 4-corner
# form survived only via its own fallback branch.  FIXES (layout.py):
# (1) closing-repeat trim keyed on LENGTH not value; (2) misalignment
# warns LOUDLY instead of silently unvaluing the ring; (3) NEW
# unclaimed-node backfill after the consensus pass — every unclaimed
# node of a value-carrying way gets the ring-interpolated altitude
# between its nearest claimed neighbours (never overrides a claim, so
# law/authority/skirt tiers unaffected); (4) NEW node_altitudes
# fallback branch (way-level tag when lengths still align, flat mean
# otherwise); (5) invalid-repair _alt_for_nid indexing fixed (was
# mis-aligned after needle removals).  Regression suite:
# tests/test_emit_per_vertex_preservation.py (6 tests; 5 fail
# pre-fix).  PER-CORNER node_altitudes ON TUNNEL PLATES IS NOW SAFE:
# the _emit_portal_cluster DEM-cut roof branch (local tree, not yet
# pushed) can drop its hi/lo workaround and emit
# node_altitudes=[eh, el, el, eh, eh] per the owner's preference.
# NOTE pre-existing flake seen while verifying: to_osm stamps a
# second-resolution o4_provenance 'built' timestamp, so
# test_to_osm_is_idempotent fails when its two emits straddle a
# second boundary (loaded suite runs) — unrelated to this fix.

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PART 36 IN PROGRESS (20260710 PM session) — READ THIS FIRST
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SLICE B IS UNDERWAY.  Design doc (Noah-approved, criterion list
# includes the sub-2-minute build target):
# docs/slice_b_solver_absorption_design.md.  Five stages B0-B5;
# ordering forced by parent relationships (skirts before gaps before
# bands); reuses the object-bridge plate admission precedent.
#
# LANDED (all verified on the integrated tree, audit A/B per landing):
# * 9f68a25 queue item 8 — full_airport_build check_grade subprocess
#   uses sys.executable (worktree-safe).
# * 72c722a queue item 6 — audit class 4 INTERIOR EDGE CROSSINGS +
#   attribution: ALL 18 at CYXY are the crown-ridge crossing-continuity
#   mechanism BY DESIGN (16 crown_spine~runway/runway_crossing internal
#   seams + 2 ridge~ridge without a shared node, ledgered for slice-B
#   exactification).  NOT band clip residues — 6th overturned
#   diagnosis.  Watch class requiring attribution, not a violation
#   inventory.
# * 162aaca + ad7d8d7 — the slice B design doc + performance
#   acceptance criterion 8 (Noah ruling: refinements must simplify;
#   CYXY full build UNDER 120 s; measured split at baseline: 62.9%
#   post-solve emit march / 34.7% solve / ~2.5% phase-1 — the march
#   the absorption deletes IS the bottleneck).
# * 1ada9ac queue item 5 — site-2 6 mm residual: GEOS clip minting an
#   intersection vertex 5.17 mm off a sibling band's corner (shallow-
#   angle band-vs-band difference()); construction-time value-gated
#   band-corner weld (1 cm reach, VERTEX_ALT_MERGE_TOL_M gate).
#   Residual report 1 T-junction + 4 crossings → 0 + 2 (survivors
#   pre-existing/unrelated).  Harness: tools/adjacent_ground_replay.py.
# * ac2b927 item-9 residual — tunnel graze-clip resample hazard REAL
#   but latent (interior vertices snapped to ring corners; metre-scale
#   only on shapes that take the safe sloped-rect path today; no
#   airport triggers the branch — SPJC/KDFW counter-instrumented).
#   Opt-in interior_edge_project on _resample_node_altitudes_nn;
#   default OFF = all other callers byte-identical.  Permanent
#   reproducer tests/test_tunnel_graze_resample.py.
# * 34c286b SLICE B STAGE B0 — interval-edge primitive (symmetric
#   3-tuple untouched; 4-tuple signed slab, None = unbounded; both
#   projection paths; _margined_interval) + O4_ONE_SOLVE_TERRAIN
#   master gate + per-role sub-gates (all OFF).  Byte-identity proven
#   TWICE (same-path stash A/B, pinned hash seed).  DEFERRED: reach-
#   envelope warm-start over signed slabs (no interval edges exist
#   until B1-B3; POCS sweep converges regardless — documented in code).
# * 0d58750 queue item 4 — skirt edge-grade: attribution REFUTED (7th
#   overturn; not corner arbitration).  to_osm consensus averaged two
#   SOFT claims (skirt 693.1 + strip 692.3 → 692.7 valley) because no
#   authority claimed the node.  Fix: consensus priority law >
#   authority > runway-end skirt > all-soft mean.  Skirt class 2 → 0.
#   SECOND emit-consensus arbitration defect this part (with site-2):
#   both classes unrepresentable under absorption — more slice-B
#   delete-it evidence.  Harness: tools/skirt_value_replay.py.
#
# ALSO LANDED (later same session):
# * 9f5e816 STAGE B1 — skirts absorbed as HARD PINS (36 at CYXY);
#   gate-ON residual IMPROVED 0+2 → 0+1; consensus skirt-tier hits
#   84→82 (identity retires skirt-vs-pavement; skirt-vs-strip waits
#   for B3).  Byte-identical gate-OFF, twice-proven.
# * 1710430 STAGE B2 — gap spines = FREE solver variables (446 nodes,
#   798 envelope interval edges, fairing law, crown-frozen, open-way
#   float KEPT — the endpoint-interning clause was a STALE docstring;
#   8th-10th overturned diagnoses this arc).  ABSORPTION SIGNATURE
#   measured: Solving +9.7 s / Emitting −9.4 s.  Spine values move off
#   the analytic target BY DESIGN (median 0.24 m; worst 23.5 m in the
#   3 largest open-floor gaps) — ★ROUND-7 IN-SIM looks there first.
#   ★MEASURED NEGATIVE: bare POCS does NOT suffice for interval
#   subgraphs (main yield call exhausts its visit budget; cheap, but
#   the B0-deferred interval warm-start is now a HARD B3 PREREQUISITE
#   before interval edges multiply ~30×).  1 of 17 faces = loud
#   analytic fallback (non-verbatim skirt-residual boundary, B3).
# * f366c2f SKIRT AIRSIDE PRECEDENCE SWAP (Noah ruling): the REAL
#   backwards clip was emit_runway_end_skirts' static_block including
#   groundside (the queued line numbers pointed at
#   emit_surface_clearance_cuts, whose exclusion is the SEPARATE
#   2026-07-09 ruling — untouched).  Groundside now trims around
#   skirts, chain verbatim.  Firing census 0 at CYXY/KCLT/HECA —
#   inert everywhere probed; synthetic contract tests carry it.
#   Ribbons+DEM bridges CONFIRMED retired (vestigial code = slice-C
#   deletion candidates, incl.
#   _reconcile_boundary_bridges_with_skirts).
#
# NEXT (part-36 continuation order):
# 1. INTERVAL WARM-START — LANDED 908dea4 (same session).  Diagnosis:
#    4 disjoint-slab interval edges = 26.96M of 27.75M capped visits
#    (two-parent slabs going disjoint as stations move; the B2 seed
#    prune could not see it).  Fix: _reach propagates DIRECTED bounds
#    over signed slabs; floor>ceiling break quarantines the
#    infeasible; strict pop guards kept.  Main yield 27.75M capped →
#    31,134 DRAINED; replay 7.3 s → 0.05 s; gate-ON build 150 s;
#    EVERY check_grade class improved or held (within-shape
#    1240→1108, plane 4→2); nodes 4,403; gates-OFF byte-identical.
#    Harness: tools/interval_reach_replay.py (O4_DUMP_SOLVE_STATE
#    snapshot → 0.05 s standalone projection replay).
# 2. B3 BANDS — ORDER 1 LANDED 7efc1be (+ cdda083 LineString shadow
#    fix): construction move behind DEVELOPMENT gate
#    O4_ONE_SOLVE_TERRAIN_GRADED_STRIP_CONSTRUCT (default OFF) +
#    (role, ref) admission split (collision closed).  Scout
#    corrections: clip STAYS at emission (legacy clearance cuts are
#    post-solve default-ON); emitter truly CONSUMES pre-built
#    footprints.  ★DEFERRED ACCEPTANCE: construct-ON = 82 bands vs 67
#    / nodes 4,535 vs 4,403 / +14.8 s — cause isolated to the
#    pre-solve march seeing the UNDECIMATED pre-densification
#    pavement ring; resolution = order 2's shared-variable rings; the
#    construct gate must NOT flip default before order 2 closes it.
#    ORDER 2 LANDED 94f462f (three scout refutations ratified first,
#    design doc 79800ab — band law = PER-VERTEX two-sided DEM clamp,
#    NO caps/fairing; seam-taper pin = footprint machinery, stays;
#    two-phase store + emit re-derivation over the FINAL chain):
#    82 bands COLLAPSED TO 67 ✓ · 7,121 interval edges all DRAINED
#    (warm-start held at 10x) · byte gates pass · check_grade rows
#    unchanged · MISSES RECORDED: nodes 4,415 (+12, decimation
#    yield) · criterion-8 gate-ON Solving +36.8 s / NO Emitting
#    shrink — the emit march survives until the SEED-VS-SOLVED
#    COVERAGE GAP closes (24 shapes / 1,285 fallback vertices; the
#    plan's conservative reach margin was never built).  ORDER 2.5:
#    CANCELLED BY ITS OWN SCOUT (no code; the premise was false).
#    MEASURED TRUTH: Emitting = 96% emit_surface_clearance_cuts
#    (87.7 s legacy chain, hole_router-dominated = the B4 deletion
#    target); the band emit is 0.39 s; the POCS solve itself is
#    2.4 s — the "Solving" phase is ~40 s object-bridge
#    classification (KBNA worktree carries a 53x fix + pack-sidecar
#    cache; merge-time lever) + reach-band feasibility.  Post-B4
#    projection ≈ 65-75 s, well under the 120 s target.  The
#    coverage gap (24 shapes / 1,285 fallback vertices) is
#    RE-SCOPED as a QUALITY ledger item (values move to solved,
#    in-sim-gated).  ORDER 3 LANDED ed61dde — B3 STRUCTURALLY
#    COMPLETE: wrap (O4_ADJACENT_GROUND_END_WRAP, OFF; taxiway-end
#    halt was the terrain probe treating the SKIRT as obstruction,
#    not the outward-normal test — taxiways have axis=None) +
#    tunnel-ramp standoff (O4_ADJACENT_GROUND_TUNNEL_STANDOFF, OFF;
#    PREMISE OVERTURNED 16th — the 2 SPJC tears do not reproduce,
#    SPJC emits 0 tunnels in this tree, KDFW zero-bores class, both
#    stay on the in-sim tunnel watch; standoff = synthetically
#    proven guard).  ★THE COVERAGE-GAP QUALITY ITEM IS NOW
#    LOAD-BEARING FOR B4: the wrap adds 0 bands in the solver-path
#    build (DEM-seeded march sees no violation at the taxiway end;
#    fires correctly in the legacy path) — acceptance criterion 4
#    cannot be demonstrated until the pre-solve march covers
#    solved-value violations.  COVERAGE CLOSURE LANDED e1ff071
#    (direction INVERTED by the scout — 17th: CUT tests the band
#    FLOOR, FILL the CEILING; superset proven): fallback 1,289→58 ·
#    store-missing 25→3 · zero new tears · WITHIN 1108→1103 · the
#    LAST post-weld crossing RESOLVED (0T+0X full-ON) · census 69
#    unchanged · cost solve 51→95 s gate-ON (10 m step lever
#    untouched).  ~1,231 vertices move analytic→solved = the
#    round-7 quality class.  ★WRAP REFUTED AT THE RULING SITE
#    (18th) — NOAH RULING NEEDED: the wrap fires 0 bands at
#    60.6972471,-135.0608669 in EVERY path incl. legacy — (a) bands
#    are VIOLATION-driven and the solved taxiway end sits
#    in-corridor (nothing to wrap); (b) nearest skirt = 90.7 m,
#    outside probe range — no taxiway-end-onto-skirt subject at the
#    site geometry.  ★NOAH RULED (2026-07-11): RE-EXAMINE IN-SIM
#    FIRST — criterion 4 folds into round 7 (look at the site and
#    any taxiway end near a skirt with the B3 gates ON; decide
#    whether current output already reads correctly or where the
#    wrap form is actually wanted); NO wrap code until then; the
#    built machinery stays gated off as a guard.
# 3. NOAH IN-SIM ROUND 7 — gates everything downstream (B4 charter +
#    legacy deletion, then B5 projection retirement).  BAKE CONFIG:
#    all five one-solve terrain gates ON (O4_ONE_SOLVE_TERRAIN +
#    RUNWAY_END_SKIRT + GAP_FILL_SPINE + GRADED_STRIP_CONSTRUCT +
#    GRADED_STRIP) + O4_ADJACENT_GROUND_END_WRAP=1 (so the wrap can
#    be judged) + O4_AUTO_PATCH_REBUILD=1.  ★ROUND-7 DEFAULTS ARE
#    COMMITTED (fad621d): a plain build IS the full-on build now.
#    ★★★ NOAH RULING 2026-07-11 FINAL (REVERSES the same-day interim
#    "no dips" reaction; the interim fix order was KILLED, nothing
#    landed): LEAVE THE B2 GAP BEHAVIOR AS IS.  Real airports have
#    large fully-surrounded infields with SUBSTANTIAL genuine drops;
#    only the graded zone near pavement is actually graded — the
#    deep interior lawfully follows terrain, so the open floor is
#    CORRECT for large gaps.  The CYXY big-gap dip is INVALID DEM —
#    a DATA problem; never bend grade law to paper over bad DEM
#    (closed floors would break airports whose dips are real).  The
#    -12 m band dip at 60.71804,-135.07291 is likely the same
#    class (both DEM readers agree the terrain dips).
#    ★ROUND-7 VERDICT (Noah, in-sim, 2026-07-11): the airport looks
#    essentially the SAME as before the absorption — which is the
#    PASS condition for a foundational refactor (every stage's
#    acceptance was no-visual-change).  The absorption is RATIFIED
#    in-sim; the visible-improvement stage is B4.  CRITERION 4
#    RESOLVED: taxiway-end sites acceptable as-is — the wrap stays a
#    gated-off guard; B4 proceeds without it.
#    ★★★ GAP INTERIOR RING (Noah design direction 2026-07-11,
#    scout dispatched, DESIGN-ONLY — Noah ratifies before build):
#    a single mid-gap spine cannot hold the graded-band law when the
#    interior genuinely drops — the mesh spans pavement→spine in one
#    leg, putting the steep slope AT the pavement edge (evidence:
#    spine node 60.7210897,-135.0776149 is ~15 m from and ~10 m
#    BELOW the pavement edge at 60.7212117,-135.0777251 = ~67%
#    slope at pavement).  Design: interior RING at the graded-band-
#    edge offset (finite envelope floors = grade cap enforced along
#    pavement), steeper terrain allowed INSIDE the ring (open floor
#    stands, per the invalid-DEM ruling).  Scout also checks
#    (a) whether the node's frozen two-parent selection MISSED the
#    nearest pavement (a bug on top of the structural gap), and
#    (b) the B4 sequencing claim.  SCOUT RESULTS (2026-07-11):
#    parent selection NOT a bug (the 15 m pavement IS a frozen
#    parent; its band ends at 12.5 m; open floor lawful) — purely
#    the structural triangulation defect Noah diagnosed (73% at the
#    evidence site; 185% at gap #3; 7 of 8 big gaps flagged).  B4
#    SEQUENCING REFUTED (19th overturn): legacy clearance is
#    CUT-ONLY — no floor, emitted nothing in dipping gaps — the
#    ring is orthogonal to B4; B4 unblocked from the ring (held
#    only on the KBNA perf fix as flip hygiene).
#    ★ROUND-8 FINDING (Noah in-sim, 2026-07-11): the violation-gated
#    ARCS create sharp cliffs at every arc end.  ★REVISION LANDED
#    05bf09f (Noah's model): complete unbroken closed loops (26
#    ways / 24 closed / 2 documented single-cut opens / 1,770
#    nodes); gating moved into the VALUES (clamp(terrain, floor,
#    ceiling), floor at min(d, band_width) — killed the 174%/23 m
#    corner-diagonal cliff class); two-sided 5% value bench;
#    per-gap economy skip; spine trimmed to the ring-2 core (a
#    full spine must cross closed loops); worst along-ring step
#    10.7% bound-limited, zero pin-to-terrain jumps; sites hold
#    4.0%/4.6%; audit zero new; ring-off byte-identical; zero
#    solver growth.  ★ROUND-9 BAKE = plain defaults +
#    O4_AUTO_PATCH_REBUILD=1 + restart Ortho4XP.  Look at: the
#    ring collars (should read as continuous graded bands like a
#    taxiway exterior) · the ring-2 edge into the open core
#    (lawful) · the 2 open chains (one-line closure options if
#    they read badly).
#    ★★★ RINGS LANDED b3cd998 + round-8 default flip 53da9c2:
#    evidence site 74%→4.0% (ring 2 rides the exact 5% band max) ·
#    gap #3 185%→~1.5-5% · 66 chains / 709 nodes fleet-wide
#    violation-gated · ZERO solver growth (floor-pin = derived
#    equality at emission) · audit floor IMPROVED to T4/NP3/
#    coincident 3/crossings 18, zero new · both byte pairs identical
#    · check_grade lockstep parser fix (open-breakline refs skip the
#    phantom closing edge, crown precedent) · GAP_FILL constants
#    dedup INCLUDED (supersedes the parallel session's uncommitted
#    edit — preserved in a labeled stash — and the spawned cleanup
#    task, now redundant).  ★ROUND-8 BAKE = plain defaults +
#    O4_AUTO_PATCH_REBUILD=1 + restart Ortho4XP.  Look at: the two
#    dip sites (now law-profiled; INSIDE ring 2 the invalid-DEM drop
#    renders steep BY DESIGN — the dial is DEM/trigger, not ring
#    law) · ring transitions at gap #3 · the taper daylights.
#    LEDGER: runway_crossing ring width keys the nearest axis —
#    flag if crossings should take the larger intersecting code.
#    ★NOAH RATIFIED (2026-07-11): TWO-RING design IMPLEMENT,
#    FLEET-WIDE violation-gated behind a default-OFF sub-gate —
#    breaklines not polygon splits · lip ring 3 m + band-edge ring
#    at parent width (TRUE runway code carried from axes, not
#    cut-segment chord) · values floor-pinned (exterior fill-to-
#    floor parity) · benched taper continuity (daylight law) ·
#    spine re-couples to ring 2 ceiling · 4-rung narrow-gap
#    collapse ladder · ~826 nodes at CYXY.  Implementation resumed
#    on the scout agent.
#    ★RING COUNT (Noah, same discussion): TWO rings, matching the
#    law's zone breakpoints exactly as exterior bands split — ring 1
#    at the lip edge (zone 1→2), ring 2 at the band edge (zone
#    2→open); annulus rows mirror the exterior band cross-section.
#    ★★ KBNA PERF REGRESSION (2026-07-11, BLOCKING, fix order
#    dispatched): round-7 defaults ON regress KBNA ~8 min → 24+ CPU-
#    minutes UNFINISHED (first big-airport run — the design's B3
#    scale checkpoint firing).  Stack sample: hot loop =
#    GEOSPreparedContainsXY under numpy ufunc (885/2837 samples);
#    SUSPECT = the e1ff071 worst-case coverage march (UNPROVEN at
#    Python-frame level — diagnosis via coverage-replay snapshot +
#    cProfile, not 20-min build loops).  INTERIM for any big-airport
#    session: O4_ONE_SOLVE_TERRAIN=0 (whole bundle off, proven
#    byte-identical) until the fix lands.
#    ★DIAGNOSIS ROUND 1 LANDED 6d8ca60 (byte-identical): hot site =
#    _nearest_visible_centerline/_paved_frac (the reach-band
#    serving-centerline scan) — 77% of the CYXY replay, feeding BOTH
#    the e1ff071 construct march AND the PRE-EXISTING solve
#    node_bands (82% of the solve; the QP was 19.6 s).  Vectorized
#    chunked scan + batched paved-frac + cached visibility:
#    contains_xy 2.19 M→104 k · CYXY build 221→192 s · KBNA
#    construct 79→41 s · KBNA gates-off completes 444.9 s.  ★KBNA
#    GATE-ON STILL INCOMPLETE — residual = the solve over KBNA's
#    45,824 zone nodes (7× CYXY) + post-emit clearance/decimation
#    on the inflated shape set; RESIDUAL ORDER dispatched (solve
#    profile split · zone-node diet: spurious-admission diagnosis,
#    gated 10 m station step, output-neutral prefilters).  INTERIM
#    ★RESIDUAL SOLVED dc7ead7 — KBNA GATE-ON COMPLETES: 667 s full
#    build (was never-completing).  Two default-ON levers, byte-
#    inert off (twice-proven): O4_ZONE_NODE_SKIP_REACH_BAND (zone
#    nodes never consume node_band; 3,575→236 s; zone values settle
#    to the envelope without the spurious reach-floor lift — MORE
#    law-faithful, CYXY delta 238 nodes all sub-0.5 m, classes
#    identical) + O4_ZONE_HOST_AUTHORITATIVE (zone slabs out of the
#    reach Dijkstra — negative weights broke it; slab moves ONLY the
#    zone endpoint, host wins by identity = pavement-wins in the
#    sweep; livelocked call 0.43 s).  CYXY gate-ON wall 187→131 s.
#    ★INTERIM LIFTED — the bundle completes everywhere measured.
#    Remaining KBNA split (+50% vs gates-off): node_bands 236 s
#    (inherent) · emit +141 s (clearance/decimation inflation = B4
#    target) · zone diet (10 m step) + spurious-admission census
#    (45,824, 7× CYXY) ride with B4.
#    ★★★ B4 SCOUT VERDICT (2026-07-11): BLOCKED — DO NOT FLIP (no
#    code changed; 20th corrected premise).  MEASURED: the
#    legacy-off gate table is ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED from part-35
#    (tears 14 / nodes +2,000 inverted / coincident 359 — the
#    341-twin class is GEOMETRIC, minted by the emit march's
#    band-vs-band clipping; the B3 "unrepresentable" claim held for
#    VALUES only).  Tears = the same coverage gap: e1ff071's margin
#    was calibrated to the clearance-CLIPPED extent; legacy-off
#    expands bands 69→485 with 2,417 analytic fallbacks (KBNA +11
#    tears, same signature).  Charter lever is PARTIAL (keeps
#    junction/RESA): −38% area not −60%; blobs #209/#210/#236 do
#    NOT heal under it.  ★THE PERF PRIZE IS CONFIRMED AND HUGE:
#    legacy-off CYXY = 36.4 s TOTAL (emit 95.9→6.5 s) — crushes the
#    120 s target; the prize and the regression are the same lever.
#    ★COVERAGE GRID LANDED 3092689 (gated OFF, byte-identical
#    default): fallback 3,527→0, store_missing→0 (mechanism was NOT
#    clearance clipping — the emit re-marches on the SOLVED edge
#    which grades below DEM and the degenerate route-reach floor;
#    kind flips + >30 m depth gaps; 21st-23rd corrected premises).
#    Zone nodes ×3.53 at CYXY — KBNA needs the station-step diet
#    before B4.  Adoption/weld rows = GEOMETRIC clip artifacts (not
#    coverage-coupled; emit-restructure scope with the 341 twins).
#    ★★★ CLASSIFICATION ANSWERED: B4 config with coverage ON =
#    fallback 0 AND STILL 14 TEARS — STRUCTURAL.  ★SITE GEOMETRY
#    OVERTURNED THE FRAMING (24th corrected premise, by Noah): ALL
#    14 sites sit at the SERVICE/GROUNDSIDE/BUILDING interface
#    (junction/service_road/building/groundside within metres of
#    every site; ZERO at wingtip domain along taxiways/runways) —
#    "steep terminal terrain" was WRONG.  The legacy blobs
#    incidentally flattened that interface; bands marched in
#    post-deletion and clamped to hosts at different levels (pad
#    ~712 vs groundside DEM ~705) ⇒ sub-metre cliffs inside bands.
#    ★★★ NOAH RULING (2026-07-11): BANDS MARCH AROUND AIRSIDE
#    PAVEMENT ONLY, for now — the interface belongs to the adjacent
#    features' own rules (pads/ramps/DEM-follow/service grade).
#    ★SCOUT VERDICT (25th corrected premise): the ruling was
#    ALREADY SATISFIED — bands have been airside-only since the
#    module's first commit; the "service_road bands" premise
#    conflated bands with LEGACY CLEARANCE strips (A3 sweep; the
#    charter is the existing removal lever).  NO code change.
#    ★LIDAR HEALS 12 OF 14 TEARS (B4 config on HRDEM: 14→2, both
#    junction-sourced host transitions = the now-tiny bench
#    question; upper bound — agent's override skipped the
#    production airport blur).  TODAY'S DEFAULT on lidar = 0
#    graded_strip tears at CYXY.  Charter flip measured on lidar:
#    25→8 clearance polygons, bands 107→149, tears 0→2 — in-sim
#    round-9 material.  B4 remaining: the ≤2-site bench question ·
#    the GEOMETRIC clip classes (coincident/twins/adoption rows =
#    emit-restructure scope) · charter extension to junction/RESA
#    (blob healing, −60%) · KBNA zone diet.  Fresh-baseline note
#    stands, because:
#    ★★★ LIDAR MERGED TO DEV mid-flight (59ddde4, parallel session,
#    ON BY DEFAULT — CYXY covered by HRDEM): ALL pre-a4e1567 CYXY
#    baselines and byte references are STALE; the invalid-DEM gap
#    dips may self-resolve on real lidar; ★gotcha composite never
#    reaches .alt — bake required; verify provider lines in build
#    logs.  After the band order: KBNA zone diet · charter
#    extension to junction/RESA · retirement wiring · round 9 on
#    the lidar DEM.
#    ★★ INSET FETCH ABORT (Noah defect report 2026-07-14, TRACED —
#    CORRECTED twice, 26th premise): the build DOES fetch (the
#    ensure_insets_for_tile step-1 hook shipped with 59ddde4; the
#    earlier "zero callers" claim grepped the inner name and missed
#    the wrapper).  The REAL cause: dico_airports mixes string keys
#    with repr_node TUPLE keys (unnamed strips); sorted() raised
#    "'<' not supported between str and tuple" and the G4 catch
#    aborted ALL of the tile's fetches ("continuing without
#    insets" — the warning Noah saw).  FIXED af2e65d: non-string
#    keys skipped with a loud INFO count + key=str sort hardening;
#    reproduced against the exact crash shape; insets suite 26/26;
#    flagged for the insets-owner session's review.  The redundant
#    wire-the-fetch order was killed (premise obsolete).  CYXY
#    683.20-vs-693.92 raw-DEM patch story unchanged — the fetch
#    crashed before ever downloading.  Remaining feature gap from
#    the cancelled order worth a future pass: per-airport loud
#    degrade lines + strict-abort option + fetch timeouts.
#    ★PROVENANCE STAMPS LANDED eb853e8 (default ON): o4_provenance_*
#    root tags (sha+dirty, 90-gate live introspection, per-airport
#    DEM lineage from bake-time sidecars — RAW is loud) + one log
#    line per airport + tools/patch_provenance.py (exit 1 unstamped/
#    dirty, --strict-raw; verified exit 1 on the raw-DEM patch).  CYXY inset cache is
#    pre-warmed NOW; Noah's rebake needs only
#    O4_AUTO_PATCH_REBUILD=1 (the 16:44 raw-DEM patch is stamped
#    fresh and will be silently reused otherwise).  ★FLIP-BROKEN
#    default-assertion tests (8-12): cleanup order dispatched
#    (env-pin, intent preserved).  ★PARALLEL-SESSION artifacts in
#    main checkout: config.py GAP_FILL cleanup superseded by
#    b3cd998 (preserved in labeled stash); untracked
#    docs/airport_elevation_insets_spec.md left for its author.
#
# ★ TRUE CURRENT BASELINES (CYXY, this tree — the part-35 numbers
# below predate the O4_OBJECT_BRIDGE_TERRAIN landing and are STALE):
# patch nodes ~4,408 / ways 387 / T-vertices 5 / near-parallel 3
# (legacy) / coincident 4 (4th = pre-existing graded_strip wall at
# 60.7088723) / interior crossings 18 (all crown, by design).
# check_grade: skirt edge-grade 0 · tears 0 except 1 LEDGERED
# graded_strip tear #366 (site-3 far-side family) · 2+5 LEDGERED
# building8/apron vertex-to-edge + mid-edge steps.  Residual
# divergence: 0 T-junctions + 2 crossings (pre-existing).  Build
# 155-170 s warm (target <120 s, criterion 8).
#
# ★ NEW USER RULINGS (20260710 PM, all in memory + design doc):
# 1. Test cycle >5 minutes ⇒ STOP, use/build a fast harness in tools/
#    (applies to agent work orders; three new replay harnesses landed
#    this session).
# 2. CYXY = first test airport for all iteration; big airports once at
#    scale checkpoints (B3); feature exceptions SPJC/KDFW tunnels,
#    SPLP seams.
# 3. Performance is a standing lens; refinements must SIMPLIFY and
#    reduce steps; CYXY full build target UNDER 2 MINUTES.  Phase
#    timings: read ~/.ortho4xp/auto_patch_build_times/*.json, do not
#    rerun builds for timing.
# 4. Zero-tolerance clarified (item-6 discussion): the ban is on
#    NEAR-coincidence (mm-cm lenses, T-vertices, near-parallel).  A
#    transversal interior crossing resolves to ONE exact Steiner
#    vertex at bake time and does not explode; the crown mechanism
#    relies on it.  Grazing-angle / near-endpoint crossings ARE the
#    banned classes and the audit routes them there.
#
# ★QT UI MERGED (fca6bef + c8cd6f0): Noah's cloud-session branch
# origin/claude/ortho4xp-ui-modernization-wjjfq4 folded into dev —
# Ortho4XP_Qt.py launcher, live map sharing the build imagery cache,
# settings window, onboarding wizard, airport index; tkinter now
# OPTIONAL in O4_Config_Utils (headless builds unaffected); PySide6
# pinned in requirements (installers consume it; ONBOARDING noted);
# 114 UI tests green after fixing a filesystem-order flake in the
# tile scanner (sorted listdir = deterministic first-wins).  Launch:
# venv/bin/python Ortho4XP_Qt.py (legacy Ortho4XP.py unchanged).
#
# ★★★ B4 ASSEMBLY LANDED a9a0260 — ROUND 10 IS READY.  The flip
# gate measured GREEN on Noah's amended criteria (CYXY lidar):
# tears 0 · T-vertices 0 (improved from 1) · near-parallel 0 ·
# crossings 18 = pre-existing crown class · re-bake hotspot CLEAN ·
# emit 98→6 s · TOTAL ~32-42 s.  Charter extension: blob gate
# (>=3,000 m2 AND aspect <2) drops the junction/RESA sweeps
# (-60.2% area; kept strips aspect >=2.8) — NOTE inert under full
# legacy-off (scopes coexistence only).  KBNA full B4 completes
# 751 s (59,314 nodes / solve 474 s / fallback 0); coverage
# depth-step diet lever untouched pending Noah.  Hygiene ledger:
# coincident 7→11, adoption 61, weld 6 → slice-C emit restructure.
# ★ROUND-10 BAKE: launch with O4_B4_FLIP=1 (+ the usual
# O4_AUTO_PATCH_REBUILD=1, restart GUI; defaults stay OFF until
# Noah ratifies).  LOOK AT: terminal areas (blobs GONE, absorbed
# bands holding) · the smooth ring collars incl. single-collar
# narrow arms · the 36.8% law-vs-law wall at 60.70261,-135.06389 ·
# build time itself.  RATIFY ⇒ flip the three constituent defaults
# permanently and the 36-second builds are the new normal.
#
# ★ROUND-9 RINGS LANDED b908d15: polygon inward offsets — loops =
# polygon boundaries, SIMPLE BY CONSTRUCTION (self-crossing class
# structurally dead; -540 lines of walk machinery); 10 m minimum-
# feature smoothing vs Noah's MOD reference (geometry only, per his
# scope note; hausdorff 104 m = the lawful code-4 band edge vs his
# freehand); audit class 4b added (validated 10 events on the old
# patch, 0 after; also fixed the tool's worktree sys.path trap);
# 14/14 loops simple; sites hold; byte pairs body-identical.
# ROUND-10 GLANCE: narrow arms now lawfully run a SINGLE collar
# (ring 1 only) where width < 2xband+20 m.
#
# ★★★ NOAH RULING 2026-07-14 (design doc 1c41ec7): B4 FLIP GATE =
# explosion-relevant rows ONLY (tears 0 · zero new near-parallel/T ·
# clean re-bake hotspot check · in-sim); HYGIENE rows (coincident
# twins / node diet / adoption+weld counters) MEASURED AND LEDGERED
# to the slice-C emit restructure — not flip blockers (exact twins
# collapse at bake; part-34 exoneration).  ★B4 ASSEMBLY ORDER IN
# FLIGHT: charter extension to junction/RESA large-area (blobs
# #209/#210/#236 out, wingtip strips stay, −60% target) · B4 config
# staged behind one review switch (defaults still OFF; round 10
# flips) · CYXY flip-gate measurement incl. the ONE budgeted bake +
# hotspot check · KBNA + coverage grid measurement with the 10 m
# station-step diet as the ready lever · hygiene ledger rows.
# PRIZE (measured): legacy-off CYXY 36.4 s total, emit 6.5 s.
#
# ★ROUND-9 VERDICT (Noah in-sim, 2026-07-14): CYXY ON LIDAR LOOKS
# AMAZING.  Remaining finding: enclosed-area rings — 9 of 27 are
# SELF-INTERSECTING loops (auto ring self-crosses at
# 60.7140893,-135.0679273; audit class 4 skips same-way pairs = the
# lens blind spot; the per-station variable-width offset walk crosses
# at concavities).  ★NOAH HAND-EDITED THE REFERENCE SPEC:
# Patches/+60-140/+60-136/CYXY_auto_MOD.patch.osm way -68615 = the
# envisioned smooth simple loop (LAYOUT ONLY — elevations in the MOD
# are NOT intentional; values stay with the point law).  RING REBUILD
# ORDER IN FLIGHT (ring-lineage agent): audit class 4b (same-way
# self-cross) + ring construction on POLYGON INWARD OFFSETS (simple
# by construction; concave gaps naturally multi-loop) + smoothing/
# minimum-feature vs the reference geometry + simplicity as a HARD
# INVARIANT; values unchanged (true-distance clamp).
#
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# HANDOVER QUEUE (part 35 END, 20260710) — START HERE
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ★ COMMITTED as the part-35 + round-6 milestone (one integrated
# unit, Noah-approved in-sim: CYXY sites 3/4 healed, SPJC tunnel
# restored to mapped-mouth form, version bumped to 1.50.0).
# ★ NEXT SESSION = SLICE B SOLVER ABSORPTION (Noah's ruling, queue
# item 1 below): open with docs/chain_identity_one_solve_plan.md
# §Slice B + this file.  The slice-B acceptance criteria are
# consolidated in queue item 1 and the ROUND-6 OUTCOMES section:
# charter ON with zero new tears · hangar blob #210 + notch blob
# #236 heal · taxiway-end wrap joins the skirt · legacy-off gate
# table clears (tears 0, node diet real) · final_grade_projection
# retires (it caused BOTH round-6 solver-side defects) · strips
# stand off tunnel ramps like buildings · SPJC no_self_overlap and
# within-shape reds burn down with absorption.
# The day's arc: an 8-hour orchestrated session (supervisor + 8 Opus
# work orders, parallel worktrees + serial main-checkout integration)
# burned down the ENTIRE part-34 queue.  Headline: FOUR of the eight
# queue items' diagnoses were WRONG while all eight targets were
# right — every fix below began with a fresh trace that overturned or
# confirmed the queued hypothesis before building.  ALL WORK IS
# UNCOMMITTED in this working tree (one integrated unit, gates ON
# unless noted); the 4 untracked DSF tools still belong to the
# DSF-object arc.  Installed tile = today's integrated bake:
# 15,037 airport triangles (part-34 milestone was 15,726); top
# hotspot cells = only the 3 known legacy near-parallel sites.
# Patch: nodes 4,420 / ways 388 / T-vertices 5 / near-parallel 3
# (legacy) / coincident 3 (was 30).  Gap faces 14 → 17.
#
# LANDED TODAY (all verified by audit A/B + tests + forced re-bake):
# 1. CHORD REMOVER (queue 1): the 1,057 m junction #101 chord came
#    from the to_osm chain-aware decimation applying removals in BULK
#    per sweep (each vertex passes the 60 m cap against its ~2 m
#    neighbours; the whole straight run drops at once) — the queued
#    suspect (chain-consistent needle removal) was INNOCENT, and
#    capping it would have re-minted divergence lenses.  Fix: a
#    coordinate-unanimous MAX-CHORD RETENTION pass + module constant
#    PAVEMENT_NODE_MAX_CHORD_M (layout.py).  Airside chords >60 m:
#    49 → 0 (+162 retained nodes; the pavement-node ruling's cost).
# 2. SEAM DIPS (queue 2): the "run-end altitude borrow" hypothesis is
#    DISPROVEN by direct resampler trace — emitted values were lawful
#    drainage-floor reads off genuine LOCAL edge reads.  The visible
#    0.72 m jog pairs = a GEOMETRIC cross-shape run-end taper pinch
#    (grade_law.adjacent_ground_supported_depths bench-in at pavement
#    partition seams).  Fix: O4_SEAM_TAPER_PIN (default ON) — seam
#    stations are never lowered by the daylight sweeps, so abutting
#    runs' outer rows align; true frontage ends unchanged; lockstep
#    mirror in check_adjacent_ground; both round-4 notches GONE.
#    Also hardened the one real borrow path (resampler None-fill →
#    arc-length interpolation; CYXY byte-identical).
# 3. HANGAR RESIDUAL (queue 3): NOT a standoff miss — the round-5
#    standoff is perfect (zero pairs touch buildings/groundside).
#    The cliffs were legacy surface_clearance vertices falling to the
#    twin path because the to_osm pavement-wins adoption gate was
#    graded_strip-only.  Fix: gate extended to ref="surface_clearance"
#    clearance shapes ONLY (skirts + deliberate walls keep the twin
#    path).  Hangar-area cliff pairs cured; coincident 30 → 26.
# 4. HOLE 27 (queue 4): the "hairline enclosure leak" is DISPROVEN —
#    pre-solve conformance ALREADY yields a clean partition (hole 27
#    is a clean 71,972 m² interior ring pre-solve AND at gap-emit;
#    zero open seams globally).  The real blocker was a 1,835 m²
#    runway-end skirt wholly inside the gap.  Fixed via item 5.
# 5. GAP PARENTS (queues 4+5, O4_GAP_FILL_PAD_PARENTS +
#    O4_GAP_FILL_SKIRT_PARENTS, default ON): building pads (FLAT
#    value authorities) and runway-end skirts (NON-FLAT inverse-RESA
#    profile authorities) join the gap-bounding union; gradeable
#    ground = gap.difference(parents), verbatim-chain gate
#    (_face_is_verbatim) enforces zero minted boundary vertices.
#    Census truth: 7 of 8 "pad-blocked" holes are 100% pad-filled
#    (lawful skips); building8's residual face + hole 27 + the
#    (-17,738) skirt hole all EMIT.  The two skirt faces superseded
#    35 corridor band polygons (nodes/ways DOWN); with item 3 the
#    coincident count collapsed 30 → 3.
# 6. SPLP RUNWAY RED (queue 8): the runway is PROVABLY COMPLIANT
#    (both edge chains ≤1.38% vs the 1.5% cap) — the red was the
#    single-poly checker fabricating a jog from the oblique
#    tile-clipped end-cap that 60 m densification populated.  Fix:
#    EDGE-AWARE reconstruction in check_runway_profile (split the
#    ring into two long-edge rails by LATERAL offset off a principal
#    axis — turn-angle/edge-length heuristics fail on oblique caps
#    longer than the width; grade along each rail with true 2D
#    distances; caps excluded; synthetic test pins that real
#    mid-edge defects are still caught).  SPLP red → GREEN; bonus:
#    SPJC vertical-curve XFAIL → XPASS (phantom curvature died).
#
# LEGACY DELETION (queue 7): FLIP BLOCKED — measured gate table on
# today's tree (O4_LEGACY_SURFACE_CLEARANCE=0): tears 13 · nodes
# 6,351 vs 4,420 gate-on (the node diet INVERTS +1,931) · coincident
# 344 (341 = band↔band twins at clip seams) · T-vertices 10 with new
# sub-100 mm classes · new 15.1 mm graded_strip near-parallel at
# 60.7065833,-135.0751807.  Attribution: corridor bands are the wrong
# tool for legacy-vacated OPEN frontage.  The unblock is the ruling-3
# OPEN-FRONTAGE DRAINAGE SPINE (one shape per corridor between facing
# pavements, both chains verbatim, spine-only solver variables,
# smooth blend, NO vertical faces between parallel pavements) — a
# PILOT was dispatched at session end (O4_OPEN_FRONTAGE_SPINE,
# default OFF); its outcome is recorded at the end of this block.
#
# SUITE RECORD (integrated state): 14 failed / 693 passed / 17
# skipped / 6 xfailed / 1 xpassed (milestone was 13/683; +11 new
# tests today; SPLP longitudinal flipped green; the 1 xpassed = SPJC
# vertical-curve, a legitimate phantom-finding reduction).  Failure
# detail: see the part-35 session section below.
#
# ★ NEW GOTCHAS (all bit this session):
# * Tile bakes REUSE the stamped previous patch unless
#   O4_AUTO_PATCH_REBUILD=1 — the freshness stamp keys on apt.dat,
#   not source.  The tell: an IDENTICAL airport-triangle count.
# * Agent worktrees spawn at upstream 3cff870 (no src/auto_patch) —
#   first action in any worktree: verify HEAD, else
#   `git checkout --detach fa335b9` (clean tree; never reset --hard).
# * tools/full_airport_build.py's trailing check_grade subprocess
#   hardcodes ROOT/venv/bin/python — tracebacks in venv-less
#   worktrees AFTER the OSM is written; run check_grade manually.
#
# THE QUEUE (part 36, ordered):
# 1. LEGACY-DELETION UNBLOCK, RE-ATTRIBUTED: the open-frontage spine
#    pilot (built, integrated default-OFF, lens-clean) REFUTED the
#    corridor premise — the legacy-off blockers are band clip
#    residues at JUNCTIONS / the airport OUTER EDGE / pavement↔
#    foreign seams, not corridors (pilot outcome in the part-35
#    section below).  Next: either band clip-seam coordination for
#    those three classes (chain-identity discipline at band↔band
#    boundaries — the 341-twin class), or jump straight to slice B
#    solver absorption which retires the band march entirely.
#    ★ NOAH RULED (2026-07-10, end of part 35): build the OPTIMAL
#    FULL solution — go to SLICE B SOLVER ABSORPTION.  Start the
#    next session there: read docs/chain_identity_one_solve_plan.md
#    §Slice B + this part-35 record, design the absorption slices
#    (a shared vertex = ONE solver variable; graded_strip/skirt/gap
#    roles join the one-solve graph; corridor envelope + floors as
#    per-node bounds; band clip-seam classes die structurally), then
#    orchestrate.  The legacy-off gate table in part 35 is the
#    acceptance target; the band march and its clip residues retire
#    with absorption rather than being patched.
#    ROUND-6 ADDITION — THE CHARTER LEVER (implemented, default OFF,
#    O4_CLEARANCE_CHARTER): Noah's clearance-charter ruling turned
#    out to be slice-B work — the terminal blobs are JUNCTION/RESA/
#    CENTERLINE unions (fresh provenance trace refuted the
#    apron/service attribution), and removing ANY clearance today
#    regresses (tears 0→10 at CYXY; clearance is HOLDING steep
#    terminal terrain the band march cannot grade — the legacy-off
#    blocker in miniature).  Slice-B acceptance criteria now
#    include: charter ON · taxiway_clearance area −60% · ZERO new
#    adjacent-ground tears · hangar blob #210 and notch blob #236
#    heal · Noah's taxiway-end wrap-joins-skirt form.
# 2. IN-SIM REVIEW ROUND 6 (Noah): the two round-4 seam sites (dips
#    should be gone), hole 27 + the (-17,738) gap faces, the hangar
#    area (cliff pairs cured), the skirt faces' surroundings.
# 3. SLICE B PROPER (solver absorption): shared vertex = ONE solver
#    variable; bands/skirts/gap spines join the one-solve graph;
#    docs/chain_identity_one_solve_plan.md §Slice B.  Today's gap
#    faces + seam pin shrank the problem but the absorption itself
#    is unbuilt.
# 4. SKIRT EDGE-GRADE COUNTERS: 6 pre-existing check_grade
#    "RUNWAY-END SKIRT edge grade" violations at CYXY (worst 35.5%
#    over ~1-4 m edges, skirts #271/#273/#282) — the documented
#    slice-A "skirt check_grade counters" class; values not mesh.
# 5. SITE-2 PRE-to_osm RESIDUAL: 6 mm graded_strip↔graded_strip
#    divergence in the pipeline residual report at
#    60.7208676,-135.0790956 — pre-existing, to_osm-interning
#    resolves it, mesh-harmless; fix at source when convenient.
# 6. INTERIOR EDGE CROSSINGS: ~18-20 in the final OSM, a class
#    chain_divergence_audit does not yet track (the seam pin reduced
#    20→18); add to the audit, then attribute.
# 7. COMPARE-TARGET FIXTURES: recut ONLY after Noah approves the
#    in-sim output (ruling stands; the compare-target reds are
#    expected drift until then).
# 8. HOUSEKEEPING: integrated unit COMMITTED (this milestone; the
#    4 untracked DSF tools stay with the DSF-object arc).  Still
#    open: full_airport_build.py check_grade subprocess →
#    sys.executable (breaks in venv-less worktrees).
# 9. (round 6 additions, 20260710 PM) SPJC TUNNEL FIXED, two-stage:
#    (a) design cap TUNNEL_LOW_CONNECTOR_MAX_OPEN_GAP_M = 100.0 —
#    applied at TRENCH-RECORD time inside the bore merge (the first
#    attempt capped the MERGE itself, which un-merged bores and
#    minted phantom mid-gap portals — supervisor hypothesis wrong,
#    veto innocent); kinematic merge restored; SPJC's 230 m covered
#    stretch stays BRIDGED, KDFW-style narrow medians still dig open.
#    (b) THE REAL MOUTH-KILLER (pre-existing since KPHL 2026-06-12):
#    the covered-stretch drop's absolute 0.25 m² pavement-overlap
#    test deleted mouth pieces that obliquely GRAZED the widened
#    runway corner (~6% of piece area) at all four SPJC entrances —
#    masked by the old trench.  Now graze-aware: >=50% covered drops
#    whole, lesser grazes CLIP off pavement with 0.6 m clearance
#    (O4_TUNNEL_GRAZE_CLIP default ON; sloped rects convert to
#    node_altitudes on clip).  All 4 NW mouths + walls restored;
#    terminal system byte-identical; CYXY audit unchanged.
#    LEDGERED: 2 new SPJC adjacent-ground tears (strip #646 welds
#    onto the restored mouth-ramp floor — strips should stand off
#    tunnel ramps like the 1 m building standoff; adjacent_ground
#    scope) · latent wall-clip node_altitudes resample hazard
#    (bridges.py ~2680).  KDFW BONUS: fixed a pre-existing solver
#    CRASH (GEOS non-noded intersection in building_feasibility
#    airside union → buffer(0) renode retry) — KDFW builds again.
#    WATCH: KDFW synthesizes ZERO implied bores today (July-4
#    "validated case" restructured by later underpass work); verify
#    KDFW medians in-sim eventually.  Cap constant tunable (Noah).
#
# RULINGS LEDGER additions (2026-07-10, supervisor session — all
# implemented behind default-ON gates, Noah review pending):
# gap parents (pads flat / skirts profiled) extend the gap-fill
# boundary-verbatim law · seam-taper pin: partition seams hold raw
# scanned depth (daylight law applies only toward true frontage
# ends) · adoption gate covers legacy surface_clearance (skirts and
# deliberate walls keep the twin path) · runway profile checker
# measures along edge rails (validator-only).
#
# ROUND-6 OUTCOMES (all six sites closed; every defect PRE-EXISTING
# at fa335b9 — none were part-35 regressions):
# * SITE 3 apron hump: FIXED (relevel_pads_to_host_pavement,
#   O4_PAD_HOST_PAVEMENT_LEVEL ON) — final_grade_projection had
#   re-stamped the DEM-biased pad seat (705.0) over the solver's
#   correct 708.67.  -333% step gone; within-shape -21; one 1.79 m
#   far-side tear ledgered (slice-B terrain family).
# * SITE 4 service ravine: FIXED (break-blend hard-neighbour clamp,
#   O4_SVC_SPINE_EDGE_COUPLE ON) — final_grade_projection's
#   feasibility break-blend draped spine nodes to DEM ignoring their
#   own welded edges.  2.06 m → 0.09 m; within-shape -95.  Siblings
#   #59/#200 ledgered (genuine hardened-weld contradictions).
# * ★ THE PROJECTION INDICTMENT: final_grade_projection caused BOTH
#   site 3 AND site 4 by overriding coherent solves post-hoc — the
#   strongest evidence yet for the one-solve doctrine's plan to
#   delete it as an enforcement pass (slice C).
# * SITES 1/2/5 (clearance blobs): LEDGERED to slice B with the
#   charter lever (O4_CLEARANCE_CHARTER, implemented, DEFAULT OFF).
#   Fresh provenance trace REFUTED the apron/service attribution —
#   the blobs are JUNCTION/RESA/CENTERLINE unions, and removing ANY
#   clearance today trades blobs for adjacent-ground tears (0→10).
# * SITE 6 SPJC tunnel: FIXED (design cap, part-36 queue item 9) +
#   KDFW crash bonus fix.
#
# USER RULINGS (Noah, 2026-07-10 in-sim review round 6 — charter
# ruling now implemented as the DEFAULT-OFF slice-B lever above):
# 1. LEGACY CLEARANCE CHARTER: surface_clearance = WINGTIP clearance
#    along taxiways and runways ONLY — never aprons, never large-area
#    pieces, never near groundside.  Where adjacent-ground rules are
#    not yet solved and legacy pieces remain, they behave as they
#    HISTORICALLY did.  The terminal/parking-area clearance pieces
#    (e.g. shape #209) make output worse and leave the charter.
# 2. TAXIWAY-END WRAP: adjacent-ground coverage should run the WHOLE
#    taxiway, wrap around the taxiway end maintaining clearance
#    distance, and join SMOOTHLY with the runway_end_skirt (site:
#    60.6972471,-135.0608669).
# 3. Round-6 defect sites (traces in flight): hangar hotspot shapes
#    #211/#212 (worst; steep angles pull taxiway edges down) · apron
#    hump 60.70889,-135.07304 · service-road spine-vs-edge ravine
#    60.70870,-135.07463 · groundside cliffs at #209.
# 4. Pre-slice-B policy (agreed): fix-now ONLY defects in surviving
#    machinery or covered by ruling 1; coexistence artifacts go to
#    the slice-B ledger as named acceptance criteria, not fixes.

# STATUS — SESSION 20260710 (part 35): ORCHESTRATED QUEUE BURN-DOWN —
# the whole part-34 queue, supervisor + 8 Opus work orders (parallel
# worktree diagnosis/development, serial main-checkout integration
# with audit A/B per step).  Full detail in the queue block above;
# this section holds the records the block references.

## SUITE RECORD (integrated state, this tree)
Full run: 14 failed / 693 passed / 17 skipped / 6 xfailed / 1 xpassed
(998 s, 18 xdist workers, under parallel agent load).  Milestone
reference was 13 failed / 683 passed; +11 new tests were added today
(8 gap-parent + 2 seam-taper + 1 edge-aware synthetic), and
test_runway_longitudinal_grade[SPLP] flipped RED → GREEN.  The 1
xpassed = test_runway_vertical_curve[SPJC] (strict=False): the old
both-rails-MIN reconstruction fabricated phantom curvature; the
edge-aware profile removed it — a finding reduction, not a mask.
Ten failures re-confirmed by targeted foreground re-runs, all
documented pre-existing families:
  compare-target drift ×3 (spjc · splp baseline0-114 ·
    splp baseline1-176) — EXPECTED until fixtures recut post-approval
  test_pavement_grade[SPLP/CYXY/SPJC/HECA] ×4 — within-shape grade
    via check_grade (not the runway profile)
  test_cyxy_spine_zero_no_bowl — taxi-spine/building bowls
  test_solver_validator_same_edge_budgets@CYXY
  test_route_band_zero[SPJC] — 240 route-band violations (stash-A/B
    confirmed pre-existing at the milestone by the seam-dip agent)
CORRECTION (end-of-day full run, 14 failed / 709 passed — the set is
STABLE, all 14 now named): the earlier "4 non-reproducers" were
test_no_self_overlap[SPLP/SPJC/CYXY] and test_route_reach_zero[CYXY]
— their FILES were simply not in the targeted re-run set (the
junction/grade files that were re-run are green).  route_reach was
A/B-confirmed byte-identical pre-existing during the site-4 fix;
no_self_overlap ×3 provenance is UNVERIFIED pre-existing (suspected
in the milestone 13; one stash A/B if purity is wanted).  End-of-day
14 = compare-target ×3 (expected drift) · pavement_grade within-shape
×4 · no_self_overlap ×3 · spine_zero_no_bowl · route_reach_zero ·
solver_validator_same_edge_budgets · route_band_zero[SPJC].

## VERIFICATION CHAIN (every integration step)
chain_divergence_audit A/B per landing (gate: zero new near-parallel
/ T-vertices) → CYXY full_airport_build → check_grade → forced warm
re-bake (O4_AUTO_PATCH_REBUILD=1) + mesh_hotspot_cells at
checkpoints.  Progression of the CYXY patch through the day:
  milestone:   nodes 4,481 · coincident 30 · gaps 14 · bake 15,726
  +chord fix:  nodes 4,643 (retention +162) · chords>60m 49→0
  +adoption:   nodes 4,639 · coincident 26 (4 hangar cliffs cured)
  +gap parents:nodes 4,435 · coincident 3 · gaps 17 · bands 106→71
  +seam pin:   nodes 4,420 · ways 388 · bake 15,037 · T5/NP3
              (audit floor = the 3 known legacy near-parallel sites)
check_grade at the final state: tears 0 · cross-shape 0 ·
vertex-to-edge 0 · mid-edge 0 · skirt edge-grade 6 (pre-existing
class, queue item 4 above).

## ORCHESTRATION NOTES (what worked, for repeat sessions)
* 5 parallel worktree agents + serialized main-checkout landings; no
  emission-edit collisions; foreground-only rule held (zero
  background-wait violations across 8 work orders).
* Work orders that carried NUMERIC baselines (audit counts, bake
  triangle counts, exact coordinates) produced verifiable reports;
  SendMessage mid-run corrections (wrong worktree commit, revised
  bake reference) were picked up cleanly.
* 4 of 5 worktrees spawned at upstream 3cff870 — the fix
  (git checkout --detach fa335b9) is now a standard first action.
* The day's meta-lesson, written into memory: the queue's TARGETS
  were all right; four of its DIAGNOSES were wrong.  Fresh trace
  before building the queued fix, every time.

## OPEN-FRONTAGE SPINE PILOT (dispatched end of session)
O4_OPEN_FRONTAGE_SPINE default OFF, developed in an isolated
worktree seeded with today's integrated diff.  Target: the queue-7
gate table (tears 13→0, nodes < 4,420, coincident ~single digits,
zero new sub-100 mm classes).  Outcome recorded here when the pilot
reports:
* PILOT OUTCOME: BLOCKED (truthful) — and it REFUTES the corridor
  premise, the day's FIFTH overturned diagnosis.  The pilot is
  mechanically complete and lens-clean (10 genuine corridors emitted,
  ZERO new near-parallel in both configs, gate-off = byte-identical
  no-op, test-pinned; 18 gap + 104 adjacent/layout/conformance tests
  green) and is INTEGRATED into this tree default-OFF
  (O4_OPEN_FRONTAGE_SPINE; config.py + gap_fill.py + 5 tests).  But
  the legacy-off gates are unreachable via corridors at CYXY: tears
  13→12, nodes 6,351→6,114 (target < 4,420), coincident 344→291.
  ROOT CAUSE: the residual tears/twins are within-shape band clip
  residues at PAVEMENT JUNCTIONS, the AIRPORT OUTER EDGE, and
  pavement↔foreign (groundside/service) seams — structurally NOT
  wide open pavement↔pavement corridors; CYXY's between-pavement
  frontage is not corridor-dominated.  Known small residual in the
  pilot itself (unbuilt, does not change the verdict): corridor-spine
  longitudinal jumps from _spine_interval's two-nearest-parent
  switching (worst 7.33% over one 15 m station) — needs a
  longitudinal slope-limiter if the pilot is ever promoted.

# STATUS — SESSION 20260709 (part 34): CHAIN IDENTITY SLICE A —
# VERDICT: THE ADJACENT-GROUND PROJECT FLIES.  CYXY tile bake with the
# FULL WELD + BANDS: 24,333 airport-region triangles, BELOW the
# pre-weld no-bands baseline (26,727; the naive weld exploded to
# 1,552,854).  Total tile 633,530 vs 635,934 — welded bands are
# triangle-NEGATIVE.  Doc: docs/chain_identity_one_solve_plan.md.

## USER RULINGS (Noah, part 34)
1. ONE-SOLVE DOCTRINE (architecture): all rules/laws live in
   grade_law; the solver solves as many elevations as possible in ONE
   pass; minimize/eliminate post-solve geometry or elevation mutation.
   Approved slices: A chain identity (DONE, this session) → B solver
   absorption (bands/skirts as solver nodes; a shared vertex = ONE
   variable — the weld/consensus/conformance apparatus evaporates) →
   C emit reduction.
2. SOLVER PERFORMANCE is a first-class goal, architecture-level and
   opportunistic.  Precision reframe: NO cm/mm fidelity needed — the
   output is grading UNDER pavement, layered over; smooth required,
   simplification fine.
3. Zone-3 vertical faces lawful ONLY at a TRUE outer edge (no shapes
   beyond); between parallel pavements the ground must smoothly blend
   runway-drainage → taxiway-shoulder (NOT built yet — slice B work).
4. Fixture recut ONLY after Noah approves final in-sim output.
5. Corner arbitration: PAVEMENT value always wins at pavement nodes.
6. Skirt anchor fix committed separately: dev 9345739.

## THE METHOD (this is the durable lesson)
* GATE = ZERO near-parallel constrained pairs.  ONE lens (mm-scale,
  metres long) Ruppert-refines to 10⁵-10⁶ tile triangles — "only a
  few sites left" is not a state, it is an explosion.  Slice A
  round 1 REDUCED sites 136→36 and the bake got WORSE (3.0M).
* The loop: tools/chain_divergence_audit.py (patch-level T-vertices
  by perp bin + near-parallel pairs + coincident nids, by role pair;
  seconds) → tools/full_airport_build.py (~8 min) → warm tile bake
  ~3 min (tools/run_tile_build.py 60 -136 1 "<Custom Scenery
  zOrtho4XP_+60-136>" — the runner now takes build_dir as arg 4) →
  tools/mesh_hotspot_cells.py (25 m cells; hotspots map 1:1 to
  audited lens sites; µm-scale medians = ping-pong, m² = lawful).
* Pipeline now prints a post-weld residual-divergence report (any
  conformance violation surviving the final weld, with lat/lon).

## THE FIX CHAIN (landing order; all in the working tree, UNCOMMITTED)
1. WELD-ROW DIET (adjacent_ground): band inner rows at d0=0 are the
   PAVEMENT CHAIN SUBSEQUENCE (ring vertices — every k==0 station IS
   a ring vertex — plus run endpoints); interior 5 m stations left
   the weld row.  Final-weld insertions 3,527 → ~540; patch nodes
   12,895 → 10,032.
2. CONFORMANCE SILENT-BAIL BUG (conformance.py): a candidate landing
   on TWO edges of one ring was inserted twice → invalid rebuild →
   the shape silently kept ZERO welds (the immortal
   junction~runway_clearance 53).  Fix: first-edge-wins ownset
   dedup + loud bail WARN.
3. Boundary-frozen `_merge_coincident` (clearance, Opus agent):
   frozen_predicate at 1e-6 on the static boundary; frozen coords win
   verbatim, never the mean.
4. CONFORM-ADOPT (adjacent_ground): band ring edges SPLIT at static
   vertices within 0.2 m, then all vertices SNAP onto the static
   exterior — a soft ring adopts the static chain wherever it runs
   within tolerance (kills the mid-span-edge-next-to-corner class).
5. TWO-PHASE SEAM-SAFE legacy _finalize (clearance, Opus agent):
   collect all piece rings first → mm-key shared-seam set → decimate/
   drop-sharp/merge protect seam vertices.  (Per-piece independent
   decimation had desynced sibling seams — ONE such lens at
   60.7014,-135.0630 was 1.57M triangles.)
6. ★ THE KEYSTONE — NID-LEVEL FINAL WELD in layout.to_osm: the 0.5 m
   canonical interning MOVES vertices AFTER the layout-level weld
   (the KPHX 9.3°→0.36° note admits it), so the T-vertex weld re-runs
   on the FINAL nid rings at the FINAL coordinates (insert existing
   nids into ways whose edges they lie on; consensus rides the nid —
   no altitude bookkeeping).  15 insertions killed every sub-cm
   divergence class.  Must stay the LAST geometry-affecting step.
7. SELF-LENS REPAIR (adjacent_ground._repair_self_lenses): the snap
   can collapse a thin cut residue into an out-and-back sub-µm pinch
   INSIDE one ring (band -10391 doubling back along the runway line
   = the last 182k-triangle hotspot).  Insert the ring's OWN vertices
   into edges they graze (≤5 mm) → exact self-touch → buffer(0)
   splits into clean lobes.
* MEASURED NEGATIVE (kept in code comments): projection-onto-chord
  needle repair is WRONG — near-parallel 136→200; most tips sit on a
  welded HOST edge whose ring does not reference the nid, and moving
  the tip pulls the chain off the host.  Removal + chain-consistent
  partner removal stays.

## VERIFIED (part 34)
* chainid6 audit: near-parallel 136→1 (a legacy surface_clearance
  pair; the healthy pre-weld baseline itself reads 1) · T-vertices
  136→8 (all ≥1 cm legacy/wall classes).
* CYXY bake (chainid6 patch installed at
  Patches/+60-140/+60-136/CYXY_auto.patch.osm, tile BAKED and READY
  TO FLY): airport bbox 24,333 tris (baseline 26,727, naive weld
  1.55M, slice-A round 1 3.0M); worst hotspot cell 113 tris at
  m²-scale medians.  Pre-weld patch + mesh preserved in the session
  scratchpad (bake_ab/).
* FULL suite: 14 failed / 672 passed — all mapped: the documented
  pre-existing set (pavement_grade SPLP/SPJC/CYXY/HECA,
  no_self_overlap[SPJC], route_band_zero[SPJC], cyxy_route_reach,
  edge_budgets, dsf_object flag-gating, cyxy_spine_zero_no_bowl
  22 cm) + compare-target ×3 weld drift (EXPECTED per ruling 4 —
  recut awaits approval).  ⚠ test_solver_and_validator_same_nodes
  attribution NOT A/B'd vs the pre-slice-A tree (likely the same
  CYXY solver-arc family).
* 68/68 skirt tests + 18/18 adjacent-ground emitter tests green.

## IN-SIM REVIEW ROUND 2 (Noah flew the slice-A bake) + fixes
Cliffs along runways CONFIRMED FIXED in-sim.  Three findings:
1. DENSITY (shape 261, "a thousand nodes along the runway edge") =
   the LEGACY surface_clearance chain (5 m stations + every neighbour
   vertex the final weld inserts).  ANSWER: bands got the diet, the
   legacy chain did not — it is the slice-5 deletion candidate, now
   the largest remaining node diet.  NOAH'S DESIGN (endorsed, slice B
   centerpiece — in the plan doc): for ENCLOSED gaps between
   pavements, ONE shape whose boundary = the pavement chains verbatim
   + ONE interior drainage SPINE (a swale with FAA min/max transverse
   grades as solver constraints); a few dozen solver variables per
   gap, chain identity structurally free, ruling-3 smooth blend by
   construction.  Hybrid for gaps wider than the facing corridor
   reaches; spine becomes a small tree for L/T/Y gaps (medial-axis
   machinery exists).
2. SPIKE TRIANGLES (447/448/449, 150-220 m): three mechanisms found
   and fixed: index-gap run bridging → physical-distance bridge;
   corner-fan outer-point chords across a skipped end sweep →
   OUTER-JUMP FLUSH (>4 stations closes the ring) + NO FAN when
   either flanking edge fails the station-reference test (the skirt
   owns the end zone); crescent clip residues → buffer(-0.75) width
   gate.  TWO of three shapes dead.  REMAINING (1): a 156 m × 7 m
   "isolated deep ray" — two stations lawfully marching to a real
   terrain violation near the reach limit that no neighbour
   corroborates.  NEXT FIX (lockstep required): neighbour-support
   clamp on the daylight march, defined once in grade_law/config and
   mirrored in the corridor validator — an unmirrored emitter clamp
   would mint validator findings.
3. UNMERGED-NODE CLIFF (junction 111 @ 60.6971601,-135.0592654,
   Δ1.71 m): a band vertex fused with the junction corner only inside
   the 0.5 m emit-interning bucket, where the >1.0 m altitude split
   minted a wall twin.  FIXED at _intern (pavement-wins, ruling 5): a
   graded_strip NEVER emits a wall twin against an authority-claimed
   node — it adopts the authority nid (soft claim joins the plain
   mean only).  Deliberate walls (retaining_wall, skirt lifts) keep
   the twin path.  VERIFIED: one node, 706.11.
Audit after all fixes (chainid10): T-vertices 6, near-parallel 1
(= the healthy baseline's own count); emitter tests 18/18.

## ROUND 3 (Noah: "confirmed, proceed") — the three big pieces
1. DAYLIGHT SLOPE-LIMIT LAW — DONE, lockstep (Opus-implemented):
   config.ADJACENT_GROUND_DAYLIGHT_SLOPE_LIMIT (2.0) +
   grade_law.adjacent_ground_supported_depths (distance-weighted
   two-sweep limiter; fan stations share a coordinate → zero
   allowance → fan rays fully suppressed) + both builders' outer
   scans + check_adjacent_ground mirror (reproduces the raw scan,
   applies the law, exempts columns beyond the supported depth;
   END/inside-facing stations kept as depth-0 coupling nodes).
   5 new law tests.  The 156 m blade is DEAD; adjacent-ground tears
   0; nodes −331.
2. ★GOTCHA PROVEN AGAIN (bake chainid11): TWO sub-µm pairs = 673k
   triangles in one cell — sub-µm does NOT reliably collapse at .11f.
   Root: a multi-way collinear seam (junction+apron+4 strips+wall on
   one line, interleaved node subsets) where the nid-weld's figure-8
   membership guard SKIPPED insertion.  FIX: COORDINATE-TWIN nid —
   when the way already holds the node elsewhere, insert a twin at
   the same canonical lat/lon with copied claims; the mesh keys nodes
   by exact coordinates so the chains weld into one vertex, the OSM
   ring stays duplicate-free.  Bake chainid12: 23,448 airport
   triangles (healthy floor), near-parallel 1 (= baseline's own).
   CURRENT INSTALLED TILE = chainid12.
3. LEGACY DELETION — GATE LANDED (pipeline,
   O4_LEGACY_SURFACE_CLEARANCE, default ON), FLIP BLOCKED: CYXY
   gate-off measured nodes −2,242 BUT ways 460→817 (bands fragment
   over the vacated terrain), tears 0→4, post-weld crossings 3→24,
   within 77.  The bands' corridor march is the wrong tool for the
   vacated between-pavement regions — SLICE B's gap-fill/spine must
   own them first.  Sequencing confirmed: slice B → then deletion.

## SLICE B PILOT — GAP-FILL + DRAINAGE SPINE: SHIPPED ("build it")
* NEW MODULE src/auto_patch/gap_fill.py (Opus-implemented to spec) +
  pipeline wiring AFTER skirts / BEFORE bands (gap shapes join the
  bands' static union → corridor march skips covered frontage) +
  config gates (O4_GAP_FILL_SPINE default ON, GAP_FILL_SPINE_STEP_M
  15, GAP_FILL_MAX_WIDTH_M 160, GAP_FILL_MIN_AREA_M2 100) + 5
  synthetic tests (tests/test_gap_fill_spine.py).
* MECHANICS: enclosed gaps = INTERIOR RINGS of the airside pavement
  union (boundaries are pavement chains VERBATIM — chain identity
  free); spine = widest-cross-section midpoints every 15 m along the
  long axis, split into two faces sharing the spine chain; spine
  values = drainage solve inside the INTERSECTION of both parents'
  grade_law.adjacent_ground_envelope corridors (target ceiling−25 %,
  20 relaxation sweeps, endpoints pinned to pavement reads).
* ★GOTCHA: shapely ops.split with a cutter ENDING exactly on the
  ring returns 1 face (unsplit, all 3 CYXY gaps) — OVERSHOOT the
  boundary by 2 m; the faces carry the exact GEOS crossing points.
* CYXY: 3 gaps → 6 spine faces (38-84 verts each, mostly adopted
  chains); band polygons 156→127; audit unchanged (6 T / 1
  near-parallel = baseline).  BAKE: **23,052 airport triangles** —
  best of the day (pre-weld baseline 26,727), zero hotspot cells.
  INSTALLED TILE = gapfill2.
* Known approximation (flagged in module): a parent runway's code
  NUMBER derives from its longest vertex chord (no rw_axes plumbed) —
  revisit when slice B moves construction pre-solve.

## GAP-FILL EXTENSION ROUND (Noah: the 3 emitted gaps are PERFECT;
## why not all of CYXY's holes?)
* CENSUS (27 enclosed holes at CYXY): 3 emitted · 13 blocked ONLY by
  legacy surface_clearance strips inside · 8 blocked by building pads
  inside · 1 over the width cap by 4 m (163.9 vs 160) · 2 slivers.
* SUPERSESSION EXTENSION BUILT (wholly-inside legacy strips removed
  when their gap emits — whole-piece drop, chain-safe; partial
  straddles still block): 8 more gaps emitted, ways 460→417 — BUT
  near-parallel 1→4: (a) a 96 mm sliver between the spine's terminal
  segment and the boundary at hole 22 (shallow-landing trim built,
  did NOT clear it — root not yet confirmed), (b) 2× 7 mm pre-
  existing junction~junction seam divergences that the legacy weld
  insertions were incidentally pinning.  Per the zero-lens law the
  extension shipped GATED OFF: O4_GAP_FILL_SUPERSEDE default 0.
* SHIPPING CONFIG (installed tile): 3 gaps, near-parallel 1 (=
  baseline), **23,038 airport triangles**.  Face-boundary divergence
  snap + shallow-landing trim are in the module (harmless when the
  gate is off).

## OPEN-WAY SPINE REDESIGN (Noah's keyhole insight, round 2) — SHIPPED
Noah: don't cut the spine to the pavement edge — stop it short.
Evaluated: the keyhole variant works but its slit is a deliberate
near-parallel pair (safe only >= 0.5 m); the OPEN-WAY variant is
strictly better and uses the PROVEN crown-spine mechanism — the gap
emits as ONE polygon (ring = pavement chains verbatim EVERYWHERE it
touches pavement) + the spine as a floating interior OPEN constrained
way (o4_feature=gap_drainage_spine, layout.gap_spines → the crown
block in to_osm), ends held >= 2 m off the ring, ends take their own
corridor target (no pavement pinning — the mesh lerps spine-end →
boundary).  No split, no landing, no keyhole rails; U-shaped /
partially-open gaps need nothing special.
* RESULT: the 96 mm landing sliver died BY CONSTRUCTION and the two
  7 mm junction~junction pairs vanished with the split-face geometry
  — SUPERSESSION now audits at the absolute floor (near-parallel 1 =
  the baseline's own legacy pair) → O4_GAP_FILL_SUPERSEDE flipped
  DEFAULT ON.  CYXY: 11 gaps → 14 faces + spine ways, 10+ legacy
  strips superseded, ways 416, nodes 9,373.
* BAKE (installed tile): **22,836 airport triangles** — best of the
  day (pre-weld baseline 26,727; the whole day's arc: 3.0M → 22.8k).
* ⚠ PARALLEL-SESSION INCIDENT: config.py was reverted to HEAD by the
  other session mid-round, deleting the DAYLIGHT_SLOPE_LIMIT +
  GAP_FILL_* constant blocks (every import broke).  RESTORED from
  the agents' reports.  The same-checkout hazard is real — commit
  slice A+B soon, stage explicitly.

## THE PAVEMENT-NODE RULE (Noah, round 3): grading shapes NEVER
## create a node on a pavement edge — SHIPPED, plus chain-aware
## final decimation.  BAKE: **12,652** airport triangles (LESS THAN
## HALF the 26,727 pre-weld baseline, WITH full grading coverage).
* THE RULE: wherever a grading shape touches pavement its chain is a
  SUBSEQUENCE OF EXISTING PAVEMENT VERTICES — a mid-edge value is the
  lerp between pavement vertices, identical on both sides by
  definition.  Implemented: bands extend run-ends to bracketing ring
  vertices (adjacent_ground, both builders); skirts keep exact
  pavement corners at weld transitions (clearance, Opus — fallback +
  live report when the corner lookup misses); legacy strips thinned
  per-pass (Pass A fallback/A2/A3/B thinned; the Pass-A centerline
  raycast rows + Pass-C RESA synthetic rows are NOT ring
  subdivisions — left dense, documented).  105 tests green across
  the four suites.
* MID-EDGE CENSUS answered Noah's question: of 4,698 mid-edge
  pavement vertices, 4,470 were 3D-REDUNDANT (XY-collinear AND on
  the altitude lerp) — pinned by welds/adoptions AFTER emit
  decimation ran.  NEW: CHAIN-AWARE FINAL DECIMATION in to_osm
  (after the nid-weld, on final coordinates + consensus values): a
  COORDINATE (grouping coincident twin nids — one-sided twin removal
  is an exact-T-vertex mint, measured 43) is removed only when
  3D-redundant in EVERY referencing way with ALL ways agreeing on
  the leftover chord, then removed from all simultaneously;
  ring-degeneration vetoes globally.  Genuine wall twins (Δalt >
  0.1 m) and profile nodes stay.
* RESULT: pavement vertices 6,468→2,055; total patch nodes
  9,373→4,112; audit T=5 / near-parallel=1 (baseline's own); bake
  12,652 airport tris, hotspots ≤84/cell.  INSTALLED TILE =
  noderule5.
* Legacy-off RE-TEST with gaps live: still blocked (tears 7,
  crossings 40, ways 759 — the corridor bands fragment on vacated
  OPEN-terrain frontage; enclosed holes are no longer the blocker).

## IN-SIM REVIEW ROUND 4 (Noah: "definitely much better") — 3 questions
1. TWO STRIPS along taxiway outer edges = THE LAW'S ZONES, by design:
   the narrow strip is zone 1 (3 m drainage lip, 1.5-3 % down), the
   larger is zone 2 (graded band to the strip half-width, ≤5 %) —
   piecewise-linear corridor law → one two-row slab per linear piece.
   Slice B (solver spine) can unify them into one shape later.
2. SEAM DIPS (60.7203854,-135.0788903 + 60.7208756,-135.0791845):
   DIAGNOSED not fixed — the first coordinate is exactly vertex -5167
   (694.70) in a zone-2 band: a 0.72 m jog pair sitting ~25 cm below
   the line the pavement edge implies, at an intra-band RUN SEAM.
   Suspect: the run-end taper convention (borrowed run-end reference
   altitude instead of the local edge read).  NEEDS an emitter-side
   trace vs the corridor expectation — Noah's invariant stands: the
   shadow rows must mirror the pavement line exactly.
3. UN-FILLED HOLE at 60.7132799,-135.0645661 (census hole 27,
   72k m²): TWO stacked causes.  (a) width 163.9 > the 160 cap —
   FIXED, GAP_FILL_MAX_WIDTH_M 160→175.  (b) the REAL blocker: a
   HAIRLINE ENCLOSURE LEAK — at gap-emit time a sub-mm seam gap
   between two bounding pavement shapes leaves the hole topologically
   OPEN (not an interior ring; the candidate log proves it never
   reaches the gates), and the later nid-weld closes the seam so the
   FINAL geometry shows a closed ring.  Same family as the
   junction-seam pairs: a pavement-partition micro-defect; the
   doctrinal fix is PRE-SOLVE pavement conformance (slice B), NOT a
   detection buffer (which would perturb the verbatim boundary).
   Gap-fill now logs every candidate + skip reason (no silent skips).

## IN-SIM REVIEW ROUND 5 (pavement deformation + hangar violations +
## groundside ruling) — fixes + one open remover hunt
* USER RULING: no clearance/grading strips around GROUNDSIDE pavement
  (it follows the DEM — it IS terrain; welding law strips onto its
  rings imports conflicting values).  SHIPPED: groundside leaves the
  exact static unions of bands + legacy strips (no welded coordinates
  against it) and blocks them via a 1 m buffer instead; groundside
  excluded from band snap targets + the value-registry preload.
  BUILDINGS joined the standoff (measured: a legacy strip vertex 1 m
  from the building8 pad corner carried a 3.69 m foreign value —
  hangar-area worst pair now 1.40 m).
* USER RULING: pavement edges keep nodes on straight sections so the
  solver/mesh holds the edge grade.  SHIPPED in layers: MAX_CHORD
  60 m caps in BOTH decimators (emit_decimate._span_ok — the
  Douglas-Peucker span drop — and the to_osm chain-aware pass;
  O4_DECIMATE_MAX_CHORD_M) + conformance.densify_long_edges called
  PRE-SOLVE (226 vertices → real solver nodes at CYXY), at the emit
  stage (before decimation/projection, ordering law) and as the
  ABSOLUTE-LAST layout pass.  ⚠ OPEN: ONE 1,057 m junction chord
  (junction #101, nids -1692→-1785) STILL survives — the layout ends
  clean (final densify inserts 0) so the remover lives INSIDE to_osm;
  suspects: the chain-consistent needle removal (no chord cap) or an
  uncounted nid-drop path.  NEXT: instrument to_osm for removals on
  that way.
* Bake (installed): 15,726 airport triangles (the +3k vs 12,652 =
  the densified pavement nodes — the point of the ruling); audit
  T=5 / near-parallel=3 (the 3 = pre-existing legacy pairs).
* Round-5 residuals: hangar 1.40 m pair (attribution pending — may
  be a lawful apron↔groundside designed step) · seam dips (item 2,
  round 4) still open.

## OPEN (part 34)
* to_osm remover of densified nodes on junction #101 (above) —
  instrument, cap, re-verify the 60 m rule holds end-to-end.
* SEAM-DIP TRACE (item 2 above): run-end taper values at intra-band
  run seams — emitter trace, then the fix.
* HAIRLINE ENCLOSURE LEAKS (item 3): find + close the sub-mm pavement
  seam gaps pre-solve (the slice B pavement-conformance arc); hole 27
  fills once its seam closes.
* BUILDING-PAD PARENTS (8 holes): designed, not built.
* Legacy deletion (blocked on open-frontage band quality) ·
  full-suite re-triage · fixture recut after approval · spine nodes
  into the ONE solver graph (docs/chain_identity_one_solve_plan.md).
* 8 post-weld CROSSINGS (fixed coordinates, legacy classes — the
  residual report lists them; slice-5 legacy deletion owns most).
* Residual T-vertices 8 (legacy taxiway_clearance/groundside/wall
  classes, 1-15 cm) — currently harmless at mesh level.
* Skirt check_grade counters (within/skirt-edge from the advanced
  profile + weld rows) — VALUES work, ruled by "pavement wins";
  not mesh-blocking.
* Zone-3 smooth-blend-between-parallel-pavements (ruling 3) — needs
  the corridor-facing-corridor law; natural slice-B work.
* Slice B: pre-solve construction + solver absorption + perf levers
  (10 m stations candidate, coarser decimation, flatness skip).
* NOAH: fly the baked +60-136 tile (already installed).  On visual
  approval: commit slice A + recut fixtures.  ⚠ a parallel session
  is active in this checkout (tunnel/bridge research) — stage
  explicitly, never git add -A.

# STATUS — SESSION 20260709 (part 33): WELD RULING (terrain strips
# fully weld to pavement — the 1 m standoff grooves WERE the CYXY
# in-sim cliffs) + SKIRT GOVERNED FOOTPRINT ANCHORED AT THE RUNWAY END
# (blast pad inside it — the "~70 m too long" report).

## THE TWO USER RULINGS (Noah, in-sim review of the 20260708 bakes)
1. WELD: the adjacent-ground bands (and every terrain-grading strip)
   fully weld to the pavement they grade next to — no standoff gap.
2. SKIRT LENGTH: skirts read ~70 m too long past the runway end at
   multiple airports.

## DIAGNOSIS (measured against the BAKED +60-136 mesh, 21:18 bake)
* 620 near-vertical mesh edges (>2 m drop over <3 m) around CYXY.
  Families: 225 band↔strip cross-shape 1 m grooves · 193 band
  outer/inner edges (zone-3 faces up to 10 m — lawful by design, open
  question below) · 119 pavement↔strip grooves (worst 11.9 m =
  pavement↔skirt at the 14L end) · 29 coverage misses · 24 open
  terrain.  The 1 m `_PAVEMENT_GAP_M` standoffs left ribbons of RAW
  DEM that render as knife-edge blades (transects show +2.6 m and
  +5 m DEM spikes INSIDE 1 m grooves beside flat graded surfaces).
* Skirt length root cause: governed length applied from the PAVEMENT
  EXIT (blast-pad end); FAA AC 150/5300-13B §3.16 measures the safety
  area from the RUNWAY END with the stopway INSIDE it.  KCLT 18R:
  124 m pad → fill to 429 m past the end vs the lawful 305.  HECA
  pads 59–71 m = the observed "~70 m".

## LANDED (part 33)
1. SKIRT ANCHOR (lockstep): grade_law.
   runway_end_governed_length_beyond_pavement_m +
   runway_end_skirt_floor_profile_beyond_pavement +
   _breakpoints_beyond_pavement (profile ADVANCED by the overrun
   length; fill starts flush at the exit, descends at the advanced
   grade).  Consumers clearance._emit_one_end +
   verification.check_runway_end_skirt.  A pad longer than the
   footprint zeroes the skirt (CYXY 02/20 end 20: 154 m pavement past
   a 60 m footprint → skirt gone).  7 new law tests; STANDARDS.md row.
2. WELDS: adjacent-ground bands, runway-end skirt and legacy
   surface_clearance strips emit their inner row AT the pavement edge
   (d = 0) with the pavement edge values VERBATIM; ALL clips exact.
   Mesh-safe: O4_Vector_Utils.insert_edge splits constrained edges at
   encroaching nodes (z along the OLD edge) + the final
   enforce_conformance(0.01) weld.  CYXY grooved 2 m frontage samples
   6,473 → 119 (98% closed).
3. FALLOUT FIXES (each found by the validator chain):
   * legacy _finalize decimation (0.3 m band) + morphological open
     bulged welded rings ONTO pavement (29 m² overlaps) → re-cut each
     final piece against static_union post-decimation; overlap guard
     on _merge_coincident; _decimate(keep_predicate=) protects
     vertices ON the static boundary (wedges 168→92).
   * to_osm consensus mean let strip values MOVE runway ring vertices
     (within 0→661, worst 42% inside a runway) → AUTHORITY-AWARE
     consensus in layout.to_osm: nodes with any pavement/solver claim
     average AUTHORITY claims only; soft receivers (graded_strip,
     clearances, retaining_wall, boundary) adopt.  Within 661→43.
   * skirt end-strip weld rows span ±strip-half-width: only vertices
     actually ON pavement take the local read; off-pavement keeps the
     ref-anchored floor.

## ⚠ WELDS NOT SHIPPABLE YET — TILE MESH RUPPERT EXPLOSION (the gate)
* CYXY tile bake A/B: airport-region triangles 26,727 → 1,552,854
  (58×; tile 636k → 2.16/2.24M across two fix rounds).  Hotspots
  (25 m cells up to 263k tris): the 14R-end junction#90/strip#263
  seam + the apron#61/building8 seam.  Hotspot triangles are µm-to-cm
  scale with ZERO vertical steps → pure epsilon-GEOMETRY encroachment
  ping-pong (the KJQF class), NOT curvature: welded seams share
  vertex chains, and any post-clip mutation that moves/removes ONE
  side's vertex (emit sliver repairs, decimation chord cuts,
  _drop_sharp_corners, buffer(0) quantization repair, duplicate-nid
  drops) leaves a near-parallel constrained pair that Triangle4XP
  refines to machine epsilon.
* Three mutation sources were fixed (legacy re-cut + merge guard +
  decimate keep-predicates + chain-consistent needle removal in
  to_osm) — the wedge tripwire still reads 27→55 across iterations:
  patching mutations one-by-one does NOT converge.  NEXT SLICE (the
  real fix): CHAIN IDENTITY BY CONSTRUCTION — every shared boundary
  derives from ONE canonical vertex chain (the partition doctrine);
  post-emit mutation of any welded ring is forbidden (repairs must be
  chain-aware or pre-emit).  Until it lands the weld work stays
  UNCOMMITTED in the working tree; the cached CYXY patch was
  regenerated PRE-WELD (foreground-atomic stash A/B, wedge audit 0)
  so tile bakes REUSE it safely.  DO NOT bake with
  O4_AUTO_PATCH_REBUILD=1 on this tree.
* check_grade at CYXY weld5: within 43 (was 0: ~4 runway pairs =
  crown-domain bookkeeping at conformance-INSERTED nodes, the A2
  crown-blind-insert class, checker-side; rest sub-0.5 m soft↔soft
  seam steps) · skirt-edge 14 (law-vs-law CORNER ARBITRATION: skirt
  lift value vs band corridor value at shared coordinates, ≤0.4 m —
  needs the adoption rule: earlier strip's value wins) · steps 1+4 ·
  patch vertices 9,261→19,602.
* PATCH-LEVEL WINS (they survive once chain identity lands): grooved
  frontage 6,473→119 samples (98% closed) · overlap 0 ·
  adjacent_ground DEM reader 0 · tears 0 · authority values
  protected by the emit consensus rule.
* Zone-3 band outer edge still ends in a lawful VERTICAL face where
  the DEM is far below (193 mesh edges, ≤10 m).  NEEDS NOAH RULING:
  keep (regs: cliffs lawful beyond the graded band) or a render-only
  daylight taper at a natural slope.
* Legacy grooves not covered by any strip: 119 samples (~240 m).
* Compare-target fixtures (SPJC/SPLP) will drift from the weld —
  deliberate re-cut needed per policy (await sign-off).
* Fast suite 8 red: 4 known named + compare_target_splp ×2 (weld
  drift) + test_dsf_object_buildings flag-gating (PRE-EXISTING: the
  4ad87b8 default flip without the test) + test_cyxy_spine_zero_
  no_bowl building19 697.78 vs ≥698 (22 cm; attribution pending —
  likely the DSF default flip: rerun with O4_DSF_OBJECT_BUILDINGS=0).
* THE SKIRT ANCHOR FIX IS INDEPENDENT AND SAFE TO COMMIT SEPARATELY
  (grade_law beyond-pavement functions + the governed/floor lines in
  clearance._emit_one_end + the verification mirror + 7 law tests +
  docs — no mesh-density interaction; 68/68 skirt tests green).

# STATUS — SESSION 20260708 (part 32): RUNWAY DE-SEG MERGED TO dev +

* FIRST FLIP ATTEMPT BLOCKED correctly (triangles 283.8k KCLT /

  skirt convention; the day-old validator caught it. Lockstep works.
* Suite gate-on 5 = the 6 MINUS pavement_grade[CYXY] (the law

## POST-WRAP CONTINUATION (same day): FULL SUITE 8 → 6
* 1ccd29f near-miss building frontage (S2): the SPJC pad↔apron 0.68 m
  DSF-vs-apt.dat source offset sat just past SHARED_VERTEX_TOL_M in
  ALL THREE reconcilers; fix = raise-biased soft anchors + law edges
  toward the already-chosen pad seat (per-EDGE recognition — the
  solve-time apron ring is sparse; stitch-tolerance widening REJECTED
  to keep the 0.5 canonical identity).  SPJC steps 5→0,
  pavement_grade[SPJC] GREEN; HECA building25 (0.81 m) also fixed →
  pavement_grade[HECA] GREEN — verified standalone: the 27-step
  service wall was NEVER test-visible (svc_break quarantine); the
  test's real blockers were the proximity radius + this one step.
  The wall stays open as an IN-SIM item (physical gates), agent on it.
* PARALLEL-ROAD WALL (part 30m OPEN (a)) — RESOLVED + candidate shipped
  OFF (anchors._parallel_station_merge_pairs, O4_SVC_PARALLEL_STATION_MERGE,
  default OFF; +12 tests).  Re-baselined at HEAD: the documented #576↔#584
  site is GONE (off-source SOURCE CLIP + adjacent-ground reshaped HECA's
  service net); the equivalent HECA pair is now 0.19 m (< the 0.5 m step
  threshold — 0 check_grade steps/cross airport-wide; the 0.845 m only
  survives O4_SVC_SPINE_FIRST=0 per-vertex).  Candidate (a) (widen the
  spine-station merge to ≤7 m with a tangent-parallel guard) FIRES only at
  CYXY -10045↔-10195 (6.7 m apart) where the two roads differ ~1.5 m for
  GENUINE terrain reasons (non-overlapping reach bands — the SAME physics
  part-30m recorded for #576↔#584) → forcing a shared seed REGRESSED CYXY
  (service tear 22.2→23.2 %, facing step 1.523→1.587 m).  Proximity+parallel
  can't tell "coincidental wall that should be flat" from "terrain genuinely
  holds them apart" (identical geometry), so no guard makes it both effective
  and non-regressing; kept gated off for a future revisit carrying a co-level
  signal (shared groundside).  Default byte-identical (HECA/SPLP/CYXY alt
  multiset unchanged; fast suite = the same 4 reds).  Candidate (b) (<5 m
  cross-shape law) not pursued: the live pair is 6.7 m (out of its window)
  and a hard law would over-couple the same terrain more rigidly.
* 03dc527 adjacent-ground law slices 1+2 (behavior-inert): corridor
  constants + STANDARDS rows + grade_law.adjacent_ground_envelope
  (enforce-fully corridor semantics per Noah ruling 1) + 33 tests.
  Slice 3 emitter in flight (gated OFF, phased CYXY-first, HECA

## LANDED (part 32)
1. runway-deseg → dev FAST-FORWARD (dev @ 8c9fdc3; dev was a strict
   ancestor — merge conflict-free by construction, as verified in
   Addendum 2).
2. DEFAULT FLIP + FIXTURE RE-CUT (2a217d7): config.py
   RUNWAY_SINGLE_POLY default "0"→"1"; SPJC + SPLP compare-target
   fixtures re-cut with tools/build_target_osm.py.  Runway ways

   junction 20→27 + SPJC junction 289→321 / taxiway_clearance 27→24
   = the neck-split corridor re-evaluation cascade responding to the
   one-ring runway; the apron 100→44 / junction repartition vs the
   07-06 fixture is 30k/30l/30m dev drift absorbed by the same
   re-cut.  Floors 0.95×current EXCEPT runway = EXACT (deterministic

  HECA = the SAME A4 dark spot (2-end rings give the curvature check
  nothing to measure); SPLP's stays correctly XFAIL (seam-split rings
  carry interior seam vertices).
* check_grade: SPLP within 31 (ALL ≤+0.11% at-cap marginal class —
  awaiting the A3 scoping ruling, NOT re-baselined) · CYXY within 1
  (pre-existing apron #29) · HECA within 2 (the A2 pair @3.57%,
  junctions #215/#226 beside 05R) · plane/cross/skirt/steps 0
  everywhere (HECA vertex/mid-edge steps = the known 30m service_road
  classes, unchanged).
* wedge_audit: CYXY 0 (target met) · SPLP 0 · HECA 4 (no growth).
* Verify-log HECA same-session ON vs OFF: +2 sub-mm junction~junction
  wedges (the A1 frontage class), −1 clearance∩clearance sliver, −1
  OFF-SOURCE phantom (30l's apron #244 30 m² @05R ABSORBED by the
  ring).  12 vs 12 total; no new classes; ZERO runway-family findings.
  SPLP + CYXY verify all-zero (SPLP runway_grade 4→0 = A4 dark spot,
  not a fix).
* flex_audit HECA de-seg parity (ON vs OFF, both flex-on): 4/158
  matched runway nodes differ, ±0.41 m max, at the two inter-runway
  reconciliation spots — flex law equivalent.  Flex-on vs flex-off
  map: ±4 m at-budget flexes, binding taxi axes at/over cap
  (flex-last holds; the one "+0.06% slack" is sub-noise).
* Dip probe: dead by construction (part 31 — no interior cross-edges
  exist under the gate; 30i tent pass structurally no-op).

## OPEN (part 32 = Addendum 2's OUTSTANDING list) — MID-SESSION UPDATE
* A4 DONE (ff332e9): check_runway_profile per-station on rings +
  crossing-slab phantom exclusion (materialized at CYXY, excluded by
  station not noise).  SPJC/CYXY vertical-curve XPASSes proved
  GENUINE (gate-off ground truth 0) — only HECA's returns to xfail.
* A6 DONE (ec7f632, found by A4's agent): seam split dropped
  from_single_poly — SPLP built HALF-DE-SEG (join anchors +
  corner reads + profile check all legacy).  One-line propagation;
  fast_suite 6 = the 5 + runway_longitudinal_grade[SPLP] correctly
  RED again.  A chip-spawned duplicate session may exist — the fix
  is already in.
* A2 DONE (f86d7ee): HECA within 2→0.  Root = the final
  enforce_conformance weld interpolating crown-UNAWARELY across a
  crown discontinuity (solver value was lawful); fix = shared
  insert-altitude rule: coincident-ADOPT for soft receivers (value
  authorities never adopt) + crown-aware z' lerp on exact canonical
  nodes.  Bonus: KCLT within 9→5, SPJC suite cross 9→0.
  pavement_grade[HECA] stays red on a PRE-EXISTING suite-context-only
  cross divergence (byte-identical A/B at bare HEAD; the known
  "standalone probes never reproduce" HECA gap) → section B.
* A1 EVOLVED (5 diagnosis rounds, 2 designs measured-and-rejected):
  ring≡legacy contour (cm); real root = _enforce_shared_vertices
  cluster-MEAN placement (pavement/vertices.py:1166) — no runway
  vertex anchors frontage clusters → merged verts land 0.27 m off
  the ring chord (KCLT), 14 mm (SPJC, a 4→14 mm knife-edge flip past
  the 10 mm weld tol), and ring stations drift 3 cm.  R1 IN FLIGHT:
  runway-anchored canonical points (runway vertex wins; runway-near
  cluster means project onto the runway boundary; two-authority
  clusters freeze).  GATE-INDEPENDENT — fixes legacy too (gate-off
  twin #792 same defect); suite-verified, byte-identity waived per
  the correctness-work rule.  Emit-stage mop-up pass preserved in
  session scratchpad ring_frontage_pass/ (superseded if R1 holds).
  R2 (mixed-regime strip: KCLT #344 internal 0.2 m steps, SPJC #141
  plane pair — slice-minted sliver, one shape/two value authorities,
  BOTH gates) decided after R1's residual numbers.
* A5 DONE: KCLT triangles 49,952 vs 130,468 (−61.7%), same-session
  A/B, runway ways 3 vs 7.
* A3 DONE (2da0ce3): grade_law.runway_within_pair_in_domain
  (station clustering 5.0 m, |Δstation| ≤ 1) applied ONCE in
  grade_graph.plane_constraints — both readers lockstep by
  construction (check_grade passes o4_single_poly from the new
  additive way tag; solver/in-memory builders exclude runways so the
  scoping is latent-but-identical there).  SPLP within gate-on
  31→12 (19 multi-station chords left; check_runway_profile still
  reports the real 1.78%/1.52% — the ruling's point); gate-off
  18→18 byte-identical no-op (fresh baseline is 18 not the doc'd 16
  — DEM-state dependent; predicate gated on single_poly because a
  short/wide SEGMENTED rect's diameter axis is diagonal and would
  mis-station).  Residue: 8 runway same/adjacent pairs (4 short
  lateral + 4 long 485 m adjacent-station chords at sparse flat
  ends) + 4 junction-way mirrors (out of ruling scope; does not
  dominate → no checkpoint).
* A7 NEW: HECA break growth 5891→6176 at gate-on is NOT A2's root
  (pair >1.5 km from any break region) — solver-time, own trace,
  after A3.
* KCLT #336 PHANTOM (Noah in-sim report post-bake) FIXED (5782ab2):
  slice EXONERATED (faces born 100% on-source); the 24.7k m² @31%
  junction spanning 18L = _enforce_runway_1to1_sharing's
  straightening chord sweeping grass + its off-source carve
  FALLING BACK on a GeometryCollection (split-keep handled only
  MultiPolygon — the recurring shapely-2 class); the 0%-source
  sliver cluster = route-proximity-cut pieces shielded from
  _drop_off_source_residue by the rpc flag.  Fix A: polygonal-parts
  filter in the carve; Fix B: near-zero on-source drop precedes the
  rpc exemption.  KCLT off-source 8→2 (#336 GONE; region now apron
  @95% + junctions @100%); HECA off-source 1→0 (the 30l apron #220
  phantom dead); all canaries byte-identical; suites 6/10; no
  real-source piece dropped (all enumerated ≤0.2%).  Provenance:
  the CLASS predates R1 but #336's face was R1-reshaped (R1 shrank
  the old −80.966 giant and the chord moved to 18L).  REMAINING =
  Fix C (formation-time source-clip for partial-coverage bands:
  KCLT #278 8253 m²@35% + #763 383 m²@32%) — own gated slice,
  candidate to bundle with the adjacent-ground law arc.
* BOUNDARY-BRIDGE RETIREMENT design SHIPPED as
  docs/adjacent_ground_grade_law_plan.md (0e085b8): primary-verified
  regs research (two-zone profile: 3 m drainage lip falls AWAY,
  bounded graded portion by role/code, then ≤5% UP cap only — NO
  downward mandate beyond the graded band = cliffs lawful; aprons
  have NO mandated area beyond the edge — wall lawful).  Law =
  lateral generalization of the skirt; 3 decisions awaiting Noah in
  the doc (FAA 1.5% minimum skipped, OMGWS keying, apron wall
  rendering).
* NOAH: bake after A1/A2 land (his call); restart Ortho4XP first
  (GUI caches auto_patch imports).
* Section C cleanup unchanged (after in-sim soak, byte-identical
  dead-code rule).

# STATUS — SESSION 20260707/08 (part 31): RUNWAY DE-SEGMENTATION —
# single-poly rings behind O4_RUNWAY_SINGLE_POLY (branch runway-deseg,
# docs/runway_single_polygon_plan.md; slices 1-5 landed, gate default OFF)

## LANDED (part 31, branch runway-deseg @ 6880c8b, base dev 773dcb9)
1. Phase 1 consumer inventory (cd5d3e4): table in the plan doc.
   Measured corrections: NO 100 m uniform grid exists (removed
   2026-05-22); the real emit surface is elevation.py's chain→
   BuiltShape conversion; profile_state carries everything a ring
   builder needs; crown rect-equalization + emit decimation are
   already ring-safe.
2. Emitter (4d41a40 + 00e68b3): ONE ring per runway ref from the
   persisted FAA profile (elevation._build_single_poly_runway_ring)
   — long-edge vertices at every profile station, per-node
   altitudes = profile(station); fully-flat profile keeps the flat
   altitude= form (MULTI_FLAT parity).  stitch_pavement_to_flat_
   runways learned per-vertex FLAT RUNS; stitch_pavement_polygons
   hosts the ring as a per-vertex peer; _build_runway_corner_
   altitudes reads ring corners.  All new paths keyed on
   BuiltShape.from_single_poly / the gate → gate-off byte-inert.
3. Seam (verified, no code): per-tile SPLP gate-on = one ring per
   tile (21+17 nodes vs legacy 9+8 pieces); worst cross-tile
   seam-gap pair IDENTICAL to gate-off (0.27 m/11.8 m, same vertex).
4. Joins/flex (26d9c4a): _runway_anchors on a ring samples the
   runway surface at the ANCHORED NODE's boundary projection (the
   ring's whole-profile interpolation otherwise pins the contact's
   station value 5-15 m up-axis onto a node 2.5 m from the weld —
   unlawful).  O4_DESEG_DEBUG=1 prints anchors.  flex_audit at
   HECA: identical gate-on/off (0 clusters both).
5. Crossings (6880c8b): axis-intersecting ring pairs carved at
   candidate stage — crossing junction = union of both refs'
   station SLABS over the overlap (cut lines pass exactly through
   station vertices), rings contribute remainder pieces, junction
   takes the legacy inverse-distance profile blend + '+' ref.
   Close-pass overlaps (no axis meeting) stay whole for the
   overlap-clip.  CYXY: 2 junctions carved, 02/20 → 3 pieces.

## VERIFIED (gate-on unless said; gate-off fast_suite = the 8 exactly)
* Runway way counts: SPJC 35→2 · HECA 56→3 · CYXY →7+2 crossings ·
  SPLP per-tile 9/8→1/1 · KJQF →1.  All per-node alt_abs.
* check_grade: CYXY within 1 == gate · HECA plane/cross/skirt 0,
  steps 3+14 == baseline · SPJC within 0 · SPLP plane/cross/skirt 0.
* WEDGES: CYXY 2→0 (junction~runway ELIMINATED) · HECA 5→4 ·
  KJQF 5→5 (all junction~junction) · SPLP 0→0.
* Part-30i tent machinery structurally no-op: HECA crown_centerline
  53→0 (no interior cross-edges exist); crown_spine ridges emit
  continuous (HECA 11→3 ways); crown_drops field intact.
* Segment-dip class: DEAD BY CONSTRUCTION under the gate (no
  interior cross-edge = no flat-across constraint anywhere).
* ISOLATED TRIANGLES (30g harness, /tmp/meshdiag): HECA 44,946 →
  43,110 (−4.1%, same-session A/B); KCLT gate-on 49,810 vs the
  130,614 recorded for dev at part 30j (−62%; same harness+tile —
  re-run the gate-off KCLT emit for a same-session A/B).
* KCLT gate-on: 3 rings (as many refs as profile_state pairs, same
  as legacy), 48 skirts, plane/skirt/cross 0, within 8 (baseline 6
  — the frontage weld class), wedges 12→10 (4 junction~runway of
  the SPJC frontage class remain).

## OPEN (part 31 — before default-on)
* HECA +2 within pairs @3.57% (9 cm/2.51 m beside 05R): junction
  vert takes the NEXT station's value; NOT a runway anchor (debug
  confirms) — suspect level/mesh coupling.  Break 5891→6176.
* SPJC +1 junction plane pair (2.30%) + one 16 mm runway~junction
  wedge: junction frontage vert 1.0 m from a ring corner (inside
  stitch snap_corner guard) never welds; legacy welded via
  canonical merges of per-station corners.
* SPLP within 16→31: same marginal ≤+0.11% at-cap class, more
  pairs (the ring exposes longer chords) — within-shape all-pair
  conflates longitudinal law (profile checker's domain) with
  lateral law on a ring.  Validator scoping decision WITH NOAH
  (the 30i centerline-exemption argument, extended).
* check_runway_profile clusters per-piece extreme stations → on a
  ring it sees only the 2 runway ends; needs per-station clustering.
* Fixture re-cut (compare-target counts) — AWAITING NOAH SIGN-OFF.
* KCLT gate-on + isolated-triangle A/B vs 1655550 (30g method).
* WORKING-TREE HAZARD: the parallel dev session commits in THIS
  checkout — 4d41a40 carries its clearance 30k fix (same content as
  dev 3d830ec; merge should auto-resolve); its 19feaec landed on
  runway-deseg.  Stage explicitly, never git add -A.
# STATUS — SESSION 20260708 (part 30m): SPINE-FIRST service-road grading
# (USER RULING 2026-07-07) — the truck-route SPINE grades at the road cap
# with DEM as a SOFT station seed; the EDGES follow the spine (cross-section
# derived, 2 % transverse law); a cross-road tear is now UNREPRESENTABLE.
# Base: dev@70ddd84.  Gate: config.SVC_SPINE_FIRST (O4_SVC_SPINE_FIRST,
# default ON; off = canonically identical emit to 70ddd84).

## THE DEFECT (reproduced first)
Part-27 DEM-follow (route_profile/anchors.apply_service_road_dem_follow)
was PER-VERTEX: every service node clamps its own DEM into ITS reach band,
so a road's two long edges bind to DIFFERENT anchor regimes.  CYXY probe
60.7092306,-135.0738928 (O4_PROBE_NODES): service_junction #64 DEM-weld
side 709.01 vs clearance-side solve 706.52/706.72 = a 2.49 m cross-road
tear on a ~6 m road (42-77 % transverse).  The tear was INVISIBLE to the
law: service_road was in neither SOFT_VISIBILITY_ROLES nor
junction_rules.SLOPING_RECT_ROLES → ZERO within-shape edges in
build_unified_graph; the validator's break-region quarantine (the 15
CYXY service_break nodes) masked it in the gate (WITHIN=1 counted only
apron #29).

## LANDED (part 30m) — three coordinated touch points, one gate
1. **LAW COVERAGE** (grade_graph.py): ``service_road`` joins
   ``SOFT_VISIBILITY_ROLES`` (gated) — the road body gets within-shape LAW
   edges through the SAME classify_pair/_bake_edge path as service_junction
   on BOTH readers (solver graph + validator import the same tuple):
   cL = SERVICE_ROAD_MAX_GRADE (5 %) along the route,
   cT = SERVICE_ROAD_MAX_TRANSVERSE (2 %) across it (the _bake_edge
   road-rate branch existed since 29b).  ``_body_cap`` gains the explicit
   service_road → road-cap branch (it would otherwise inherit a taxi cap
   from a welded neighbour via the junction fallback).
2. **CROSS-SECTION SAMPLING** (lateral_spine_nodes.insert_service_lateral_nodes
   + pipeline call after the taxi lateral pass): SERVICE centerline stations
   (densified to SPINE_STEP_M) project perpendicular feet onto
   service_road/service_junction edges — the law now binds ALIGNED
   cross-section pairs at station spacing instead of ring corners 70-100 m
   apart (the in-sim "ridge" report class).  The taxi lateral pass still
   skips SVC lines (aprons must not couple to the road law).
3. **SPINE-FIRST SEED** (anchors._svc_spine_station_seeds): DEM-follow is
   computed per spine STATION and shared by the whole cross-section:
   stations = clusters of ring-vertex projections onto the service lines;
   station DEM = member mean, LOW-PASSED along the line (±1.5 steps —
   raster noise at a lone unpaired station read as a 4.4 % diagonal pair);
   station band = INTERSECTION of member node-graph reach bands (same
   anchors/metric/connectivity as the per-vertex operator — an earlier
   station-graph Dijkstra draft left whole chains anchor-unreachable);
   clamp + the SAME distance-weighted break blend, marked through the
   existing service_break quarantine.  SEEDS ONLY: anchor (weld) vertices
   are never reseeded (mouth behaviour unchanged), no hard per-vertex
   clamps survive on edges — the law edges are the authority and the
   solve's projections (yield + final) remain the sole writer.
4. **STRICT-FRAME QUARANTINE ALIGNMENT**
   (grade_graph_validate.within_violations): the in-memory strict frame
   now excludes pairs touching a solver-exported ``_break_node_ll`` node —
   the SAME split ``check_grade.run_checks`` applies (user ruling
   2026-07-05/e2031ff: a solver-declared pocket's designed blend is
   reported separately, never counted actionable).  Needed because the
   frame predates service law coverage: with service_road pairs now
   checked, the quarantined descent blends (5.38 % vs the 5 % road cap +
   3 junction chords at 1.62-1.64 % welded into blend regions) read as
   "new" strict spine violations and flipped test_cyxy_spine_zero /
   test_cyxy_spine_zero_no_bowl RED with no physical change at those
   spots.  Scope is exactly the solver's own break export — the
   anti-gaming test (test_validator_detects_spine_step, injected 3 m
   fake step) still PASSES; empty export ⇒ byte-identical check.

## VERIFIED (gates)
* RULING PROBE (CYXY 60.7092306,-135.0738928): cross-section single-valued
  709.01/709.01 on BOTH ways (was 709.01 vs 706.52 service_road #203 and
  709.01 vs 706.72 service_junction #64); clearance ribbon follows the
  road edge (709.00/708.83, was 706.46/706.74).  Local spread 0.56 m over
  24 m (lawful ≤5 % longitudinal blend over the run).
* TEAR AUDIT (all service short chords <10 m over 5 %): CYXY worst
  76.6 %→11.9 %; the catastrophic class (>12 %) is GONE.  Roads -10193/
  -10194/-10203/-10060/-10192 cleaned to zero pairs.  Pair count 114→120:
  the residual pockets (-10205 49→66, -10202/-10206/-10201 ±) are the
  PRE-EXISTING ≤1.1 m break-blend descents at the same coords/magnitudes
  (worst 12.13 %→11.87 %), just carrying more measurable vertices from the
  lateral pass; the 3 "new" -10032 pairs are 5.8-6.6 % threshold-crossers
  whose local spread IMPROVED (0.32→0.29 m over 9 m).
* check_grade (test frame): CYXY WITHIN 1→1 (the same pre-existing apron
  #29 +0.25 % pair; the service tear pairs it replaced are now LAWFUL, not
  re-quarantined), CROSS 0→0, STEPS 0→0.
  SPLP: BYTE-IDENTICAL emit (0 service routes kept — scoping proof).
  HECA: WITHIN 0→0.  CROSS 10→8 and STEPS 17→27, EVERY delta
  enumerated (rider 4):
    - The #64↔#612 parallel-road WALL (30.101606,31.393602 /
      30.102273,31.394996): baseline = ALL 17 steps (0.59-0.92 m) + 3
      cross (80 %/0.80 m + 18 %/0.18 + 11 %/0.11).  After: 25 steps at
      LOWER magnitudes (0.55-0.69 m; max 0.92→0.69 — more measurable
      samples along the same, now-shallower wall from the lateral-pass
      vertices) + 2 cross (64 %/0.64 m + 10 %/0.10 — the 0.80 m worst
      REDUCED, one of three pairs eliminated).
    - #576↔#584 (30.108313,31.388292): baseline cross 18.31 %/0.16 m →
      96.12 %/0.84 m + 2 new 0.84 m steps (same two coords) — the ONE
      adverse delta.  DIAGNOSED (not fixed): ways -10575/-10583 are two
      NON-TOUCHING roads with a 1-7 m terrain gap; the baseline agreement
      was coincidental (both sides per-vertex-clamped nearly the same
      DEM); spine-first moved each road onto ITS OWN spine regime
      (#584 → 92.7-93.0 on its line's band, #576 stays on its welded
      94.8→93.9 descent).  No within-shape law exists BETWEEN shapes, the
      2 m proximity window correctly does not couple a 7 m rendered gap,
      and the solve-time seed debug shows no coupled nodes there.  Two
      candidate fixes queued (OPEN below); left honest — the aggregate
      CROSS still improved 10→8 inside an already-red pre-existing gate
      (pavement_grade[HECA] is one of the 13 pre-existing failures).
    - junction cross class (9.31 % + 4× 5.47 %, all ≤0.07 m): unchanged.
  HECA probes (3 spots, OFF→ON local spread): worst-tear 30.11064,31.39841
  0.63→0.42 m; -10106 30.11218,31.40624 0.95→0.88 m; wall covered by the
  step enumeration above.
  HECA tear audit: worst 33.4 %→31.0 % (same spot, dz 0.41→0.38 over
  1.23 m); pair count 48→146 and dz>0.5 m 6→46 — ALL the added pairs are
  ~10 m DIAGONAL chords at 5.6-7.5 % on the steep quarantined descent
  pockets (the part-30d "isolated roads over steep terrain" class), now
  sampled at station spacing; the sharp SHORT-chord step class shrank
  (see probes).  No new cross-road tears.
* wedge_audit HECA 5→4 (improved).  conformance HECA 39/2149 ramp 3 →
  40/2223 ramp 4: the 8 big clusters byte-identical; the single +1 is the
  SAME marginal spot 30.1075,31.4021 re-clustered (2 verts @+0.78 → 1
  @+0.80 + 2 @+0.58, threshold 0.5); ratio 1.81 %→1.80 %.
* break-region: CYXY break_ll 779→713 (svc_break 15→106); HECA break_ll
  11084→11428 (+3.1 %; svc_break 18→87).  The station blend quarantines
  WHOLE cross-sections of the genuinely-broken descent pockets instead of
  lone vertices, and the lateral pass added vertices inside those same
  pockets (CYXY +355, HECA more) — CYXY's NET quarantine still shrank,
  and the tear audits + probes above prove the quarantined surface no
  longer tears cross-road.  final-projection residual (CYXY 1→112
  over-cap edges, 10 both-hard): NOT comparable to baseline — baseline
  service roads had ZERO law edges at emit, so the projection could not
  see (or count) their surface at all; the residuals sit inside the
  svc_break quarantine (gate WITHIN=1 proves none actionable).
* wedge_audit CYXY 2→2 (no growth); conformance CYXY 35/1269 ramp 25 →
  18/1281 ramp 10 (IMPROVED — clearance cuts conform better once the
  road edges are regime-consistent).
* gate-off: O4_SVC_SPINE_FIRST=0 CYXY emit CANONICALLY IDENTICAL to
  70ddd84 (same node/way multiset; raw byte order differs run-to-run at
  HEAD already — verified logs identical modulo wall time).
* FULL suite: EXACTLY the 13 pre-existing failures (splp compare ×2,
  pavement_grade SPLP, runway_longitudinal SPLP, compare_spjc,
  no_self_overlap SPJC, pavement_grade SPJC, route_band_zero SPJC,
  cyxy_taxi_e_south_apron, pavement_grade CYXY, cyxy_route_reach,
  solver_validator_same_edge_budgets, pavement_grade HECA); 408 passed
  (+2: the two spine-zero tests below).  Fast subset of those failures =
  exactly the documented 8.  NOTE: the first full run had 15 — the two
  spine-zero tests flipped RED on the strict frame's missing quarantine
  (see LANDED #4); with the frame aligned they PASS and the anti-gaming
  injected-step test still PASSES.

## OPEN (part 30m follow-ups)
* HECA #576↔#584 (30.108313,31.388292; ways -10575/-10583): the one
  adverse delta (cross 0.16→0.84 m, 2 steps 0.84 m).  Candidate fixes:
  (a) widen the parallel-road STATION merge to gap ≤ ~5-7 m with a
  tangent-parallel guard (couple only near-parallel lines, not distinct
  crossing roads), or (b) a cross-shape service law edge for facing
  road edges < 5 m apart (the vertex-to-edge step check already measures
  exactly this pair — the law should too).  Both perturb HECA's solved
  service field → own gate cycle.
* CYXY -10205 / HECA steep-descent pockets: still >5 % short chords in
  the svc_break quarantine (the genuine contradictory-anchor descents,
  pre-existing).  The station blend renders them as single-valued
  cross-sections now; driving the quarantine itself toward 0 needs the
  mouth-anchor contradictions resolved (groundside reach / weld-level
  work, out of scope here).
* The parallel-road STATION merge (XY ≤2 m + node-prox pairs) measured
  as a strict no-op on CYXY/HECA final metrics (all v2/v3/v4 numbers
  byte-identical) — kept because it is the correct station-level
  analogue of O4_SVC_PROXIMITY_COUPLE and guards the <2 m sliver class
  (HECA #510↔#517) against regression under future station layouts.
* Emit-order nondeterminism (pre-existing at HEAD): two identical-env
  builds differ byte-wise in node-id assignment while canonically
  identical (same node/way multiset; verified 70ddd84 baseline vs two
  gate-off builds, canon sha 5a98230c9efc5edf).  Makes byte-diff gates
  noisy — worth a stable-sort at emit some day.

## THE FIX (fix class 1 — LANDED)
`groundside._deconflict_service_overlaps` clips the smaller of two
overlapping SERVICE shapes against the larger, but when the yielder lies
WHOLLY inside the kept shape the difference is empty, `parts` is empty, and
the old `continue` left the fully-covered yielder in the layout — a
100%-area self-overlap (KEQY service_junction #23, 109 m², entirely inside
#21).  FIX: drop the redundant yielder in the empty-parts branch (a
`drop_ids` set filters removed shapes at return; partial lenses still clip
as before).  KEQY verify overlap 1 → 0, coverage unchanged (kept shape
already covers the footprint at the same role).

## CLASSIFICATION (every non-zero finding)
FIX (landed): KEQY 109 m² service_junction∩service_junction full-containment.

KNOWN-OPEN — SLICE-PARTITION wedges/overlaps (part 30g/30j; the curve-native
global slice owns junction faces — cannot merge/move without breaking
elevation neutrality; the tight final weld cannot reach them without bowing
solved constrained edges).  Covers: ALL `junction~junction` /
`runway~junction` / `junction~apron` epsilon-wedges (SPJC 10, KCLT 11 incl.
runway~junction 100-163 mm, KSVH 1, KEQY junction~apron 2, HECA junction 4),
and the small `junction∩junction` overlaps (KCLT #334/335/336∩#791 [1.8/0.6/
2.3 m²], #327∩#328 [0.5], SPJC 0.2, KEXX 0.3) = task#16 KNOWN.

KNOWN-OPEN — BOUNDARY/GROUNDSIDE outline class (part 30j): the boundary
ribbon + groundside/service_road re-derive the same physical outline with
different vertex sets → sub-mm `service_road~groundside_pavement` /
`clearance~clearance` wedges (HECA service_road 2 + clearance 2, KEQY
service_road 2) and the HECA clearance∩clearance slivers (3.2 + 0.3 m²).
Longstanding structural, pre-dating 30d; the final epsilon-weld welds the
insertable seams but cannot reach solved-surface wedges.

KNOWN-OPEN — OFF-SOURCE phantom pavement (task#16): KCLT 6 large junctions
(17206 m²@21% … 2665@41%, ~lon -80.966) + 4 zero-on-source apron/junction
(496/278/135/112 m²); HECA apron #244 30 m²@0% (05R area).  Aircraft-pavement
faces the slice emitted off real source — a classification/slice question
(should be groundside, or dropped).  Rooted in the slice + pack classifier
(off-limits this session); investigate what they SHOULD be under de-seg.

KNOWN-OPEN — RUNWAY longitudinal grade: SPLP 4 findings 1.52–1.61% > 1.5%
on runway 02/20 — the same at-cap runway class as the check_grade WITHIN
SPLP=16 gate baseline (part 30i).  Emitted by the runway solver
(runway_segments/regrade/redistribute) — off-limits (de-seg session owns
runway emission).

CHECKPOINT — BUILDING∩GROUNDSIDE overlap (NOT fixed; needs coordinator
review).  KJQF building19/16 (1173+115 m²), KVUJ building8 (353 m²), HECA
building17 (6210 m²): a terminal pad wholly inside a groundside lot is
re-covered by the lot.  ROOT CAUSE (fully traced this session):
`groundside._emit_groundside_pavement_dem` DOES subtract the building union,
producing a groundside polygon with a building-shaped HOLE — but
`_dem_follow_polygon` rebuilds from `p.exterior.coords` only, dropping the
hole (verified: input holes 2 → output 0 before the fix, and 2 → 2 with a
one-line hole-carry patch).  A hole-carry patch in `_dem_follow_polygon`
ALONE is insufficient: `conformance.py` rebuilds `s.polygon = Polygon(
new_ring)` (3 sites, exterior-only) on every weld/planarize, stripping the
hole again on any groundside shape it touches (final #176 ended holes=0,
area grown).  The OSM emit is exterior-only BY DESIGN (layout.to_osm drops
all interiors for the X-Plane patch parser — same as holed junction rings,
where the punching rect's tags prevail), so the honest fix is to make the
geometry model hole-aware THROUGH conformance so check_self_overlap sees the
subtracted hole (the emit is already correct — the pad's own way covers the
hole).  That is a coordinated change to a broadly-shared pass (conformance,
touches airside too) across >2 files → tripped the CHECKPOINT gate; STOPPED
per directive.  PLAN for review: (a) `_dem_follow_polygon` carries `p.
interiors` onto the rebuilt polygon (1-line, done+reverted, safe); (b) the
three `conformance.py` `Polygon(new_ring)` rebuilds preserve `shape.polygon.
interiors`; (c) gate: wedge_audit no growth (decomposition-free, so low
risk), verify building∩groundside → 0 at KJQF/KVUJ/HECA, full suite 13.
A decomposition alternative (split holed lot into hole-free pieces at emit)
was REJECTED — the thin bridges around interior pads are prime epsilon-wedge
/ sliver generators = the exact 30j mesh-explosion class.

CHECKPOINT — APRON/JUNCTION∩SERVICE_JUNCTION overlap (NOT fixed).  SPJC
apron#65∩service_junction#72 (9.4 m², eroded-0.25 m still 5.1 → mesh-scale),
KCLT apron∩service_junction (4.3), KJQF junction∩service_junction (1.1).
ROOT (traced): `groundside.consolidate_full_width_service_corridors`
introduces it (0.0 → 9.4 m² immediately after that pass; conformance/slice do
NOT) — it absorbs+unions junction/service slivers into the merged corridor
and re-emits as service without subtracting the corridor back out of the
overlapping apron/junction.  A service-vs-airside clip (extend
`_deconflict_service_overlaps` to the service∩aircraft pair, clipping the
DEM-graded service side like `_separate_groundside_from_airside` clips
groundside) is the fix, but it perturbs the solved corridor extent/grade on
SPJC + KCLT (both FULL-suite fixtures; SPJC already carries the pre-existing
`test_no_self_overlap[SPJC]` failure that flags exactly this) → deferred for
review rather than risk the fixture set.

KNOWN-OPEN — GROUNDSIDE∩BOUNDARY overlap (task#16): KEXX groundside#17 ∩
boundary_dem_bridge#350 (1215 m²), KCLT groundside∩airport_boundary
(2.3/1.9), KVUJ apron∩airport_boundary (0.2), KSVH groundside∩groundside
(0.2).  The boundary ribbon traces OVER everything by design
(check_self_overlap's `_COVERAGE_FEATURE_ROLES` note) — the boundary/bridge
is a feature overlay, not double pavement; the large KEXX case is a
boundary_dem_bridge that co-locates with the groundside it bridges to.  Same
exterior-only-emit tolerance as the junction-hole class; benign in-sim
(overlay ribbon).  Left as KNOWN pending the same hole-aware-emit work.

## GATES (all at the committed fix)
* fast_suite: exactly the 8 pre-existing failures (2 SPLP compare + SPLP
  grade×2 + CYXY grade + CYXY terrain + CYXY route-reach + CYXY single-graph).
* FULL suite: exactly the 13 pre-existing (SPLP×4, SPJC×4, CYXY×4, HECA×1).
  No new failures; `test_no_self_overlap[SPJC]` remains pre-existing (= the
  KNOWN apron∩service class above).
* check_grade: CYXY WITHIN 1, SKIRT/PLANE/CROSS 0 (== gate); SPLP WITHIN 16.
* wedge_audit CYXY 2 (no growth).  conformance CYXY 35/1267 ramp 25 (== gate).
* Every airport re-verified post-commit: byte-identical finding counts to
  baseline except KEQY (overlap 1 → 0).

## OPEN (part 30l follow-ups)
* The two CHECKPOINT classes above (building∩groundside via hole-aware emit;
  apron∩service via service∩airside clip) — both need coordinator sign-off
  because the correct fix touches a shared pass / a full-suite fixture's
  solved geometry.
* OFF-SOURCE phantom pavement + the slice-partition wedges are de-seg's to
  clear (fewer/larger junction faces re-solved on the coarser partition).

# STATUS — SESSION 20260707 (part 30k): CLEARANCE-EFFECTIVENESS
# regression — the part-30f outer-edge DEM lift un-cut the cuts;
# REVERTED (FIX B/C kept) + new conformance PROPERTY gate
# (tools/clearance_conformance_audit.py)

USER REPORTS (in-sim, fresh bake at HEAD; HECA):
 1. MOST clearance shapes ineffective — "just going to DEM".
 2. 05R end: a clearance shape MERGED with what should be the RESA.
 3. Right-side clearance tapers into the BLAST-PAD corner, not the
    RESA corner → un-cut cliff beside the runway.
 4. Little triangle cuts in the clearance edge at runway SEGMENT nodes.

## THE ESCAPE LESSON → NEW PROPERTY GATE
The spike audit measures UNCOVERED terrain — a cut riding the DEM reads
"covered" while protecting nothing, so the 30f regression was invisible
to it (the lift even IMPROVED that number).  NEW
``tools/clearance_conformance_audit.py``: for every lateral
clearance-cut vertex, ``excess = alt − min(ceiling, DEM)``, ceiling =
nearest airside pavement edge + 1 m threshold; excess > 0.5 m =
DEM-RIDING (ineffective).  Two numbers: FLAT count (primary per-airport
A/B — includes a bounded set of lawful RESA-ramp rows) and RAMP-ALLOWED
count (above even ceiling + 5 %·d = unconditionally ineffective).

## ROOT CAUSE (empirical A/B: HECA built at 787cb6a / f2bf4f3 / 773dcb9)
DEM-riding 40/2232 (mean −0.88 m) → 508/2281 (+0.56 m) → 508 identical.
The WHOLE regression is f2bf4f3 (30f FIX A outer-edge lift); no later
commit touched cut-surface altitudes (confirms the wedge-investigation
note that the 30e/30f→HEAD diff left the outline path alone).
Mechanism: ``off = last + step`` is one station past the LAST
OBSTRUCTION, not the true daylight point, so ``DEM(off) > ceiling``
fires broadly (256 clusters airport-wide, not just sunk corridors),
tilting each strip's ruled surface from pavement (inner) to DEM (outer)
→ caps nothing.  CYXY was WORSE: 509/1337 = 38 % (ramp-allowed 480);
SPLP 24/95.
* A trapped-station-only lift (fire only when terrain never daylights
  within the band cap) MEASURED INSUFFICIENT: 497/2275 still riding,
  ramp-allowed 339 — HECA is broadly dug-in, so nearly every obstructed
  station is obstructed at the cap itself.  (Stage-1 plan corrected
  mid-flight on this measurement.)

## FIX — revert FIX A (outer row back on the ceiling); FIX B/C KEPT
The user's own item 3 settles the wall-vs-yield design tension: an
UN-CUT cliff is the complaint — the excavation, with its cut face at
the band edge, is wanted.  And the four 30f in-sim spots stay fixed
WITHOUT the lift (probes below): the needle declaw (FIX B), tighter
standoff (FIX C) and the run-taper/MultiPolygon fixes were what
actually cleaned them.  ``_build_graded_strips`` outer row is back to
``ceiling(off)`` unconditionally (pre-30e semantics, comment records
the 30k measurements).

## VERIFIED (gates; HECA/CYXY/SPLP rebuilt at the fix)
* CONFORMANCE (primary): HECA **39/2149** (mean −0.87, ramp 3) ≤
  pre-30e 40/2232 (−0.88, ramp 4) ✓.  CYXY 509 → **35**/1267 (ramp
  480 → 25) ✓.  SPLP 24 → **0**/116 (ramp 13 → 0) ✓.  HECA's residual
  39 ≈ the lawful 5 % RESA ramp rows (e.g. +13.74 m at
  30.094494,31.416804 = 0.05 × 275 m exactly).
* 30f spots STAY FIXED: 3 HECA coords inside cuts, 0 needles (3 m thr,
  40 m radius), worst ring-edge grade 3 %/3 %/2 % (pre-fix HEAD was
  4 %/4 %/16 %); CYXY notch inside cut, 0 needles, 2 % (pre-fix 3 %) ✓.
* spike audit HECA **49/38** vs the ≤48/37 gate: net +1 borderline
  sample — exact flip set identified (4 new / 3 gone, all inside the
  two KNOWN sunk-corridor partial-coverage zones 30.1164,31.4101 and
  30.1022–34,31.3946–58; 3 of the 4 new sit ≤0.64 m from an emitted
  surface = the documented mesh-constrained pavement-gap crack band,
  the 4th at 2.98 m in a zone that carried a +3.7 m sample at HEAD).
  Cause: flat outer rows decimate differently → outline jitter, not a
  new exposure class.  CYXY 224/61 (pre-fix 221/58; pre-30e 487/122 —
  the FIX C gain retained), SPLP 18/6 (pre-fix 46/11 — improved).
* check_grade: WITHIN SPLP **16** / CYXY **1** / HECA **0**; PLANE 0,
  CROSS 0, RUNWAY-END SKIRT 0 everywhere; HECA vertex-to-edge 3 +
  mid-edge 14, break 5891 — all == baselines ✓.
* wedge_audit: HECA 5, CYXY 2, SPLP 0 == baselines (no growth) ✓.
* verify_and_log HECA: identical finding CLASSES pre/post (overlap /
  off-source / epsilon_wedge; wedge 9 == 9, source 1 == 1).  Overlap
  4 → 5: one NEW 0.3 m² clearance∩clearance sliver at 30.11510,31.41375
  — the same pre-existing class as the 3.2 m² clearance∩clearance at
  30.09830,31.41876 (present both sides), outline-jitter scale ✓.
* fast_suite: exactly the 8 pre-existing failures.  Full suite: exactly
  the 13 pre-existing ✓.

## ITEMS 2/3 (05R end) — measurables resolved by item 1; cosmetics handed off
At the rebuilt HEAD the 05R box (30.093–30.102, 31.414–31.424) has ZERO
uncovered obstructing spike samples; the runway_clearance region
(-10775, 32 k m², 44 m from the 05R threshold 30.09716,31.41907)
excavates properly (airport-wide ramp-allowed = 3, none at 05R).  The
"un-cut cliff" WAS the DEM-riding cut — covered but not cutting.
Residual (cosmetic): the right-flank taper anchors at the blast-pad
corner (apt.dat 05R blast pad 65 m) rather than the RESA corner — the
ownership boundary between the 30e skirt flank-wrap, Pass A3 (which
skips END-normal stations, ``_RING_END_NORMAL_DOT``) and Pass C.  No
measurable uncovered or unconformant terrain remains there, so
reshaping that boundary is runway-end ownership work — deferred to the
de-seg session (it rebuilds runway ends; revisit on a fresh bake after
its Phase 2).

## ITEM 4 — subsumed by de-seg (documented, not fixed here)
The little triangle cuts at runway segment nodes are the per-sub-rect
Pass A3 walks: each segment's flank run ends (and run-tapers) at the
sub-rect seam, so adjacent same-ref strips meet in unmerged tapers.  A
tactical fix needs a per-ref merged-outline walk with cross-piece
altitude resampling — not cheap; the de-seg plan
(docs/runway_single_polygon_plan.md, dedicated session) removes the
seams themselves.

## OPEN (part 30k follow-ups)
* The conformance audit's FLAT count includes the lawful RESA ramp rows
  (HECA 36-39 of its baseline flags); if per-regime attribution ever
  matters, tag RESA-regime strips at emit so the audit can split them.
* Deep sunk-pavement corridors (HECA 30.115–30.116 etc.) again render a
  cut face at the band edge — by design (the cut working).  If the user
  ever rules the face too harsh THERE, the answer is a bench+backslope
  (protected band at ceiling to the cap, then a separate abutting
  backslope band to daylight) — needs multi-row emission machinery
  (today's finalize unions everything into two-row rings), NOT a return
  of the outer-row lift.

# STATUS — SESSION 20260707 (part 30i): RUNWAY SEGMENT-DIP HOTFIX —
# crown the interior cross-edges (de-seg plan Phase 0, docs/
# runway_single_polygon_plan.md).  User: "airports unusable as is".
#
# THE DEFECT: a crowned runway emits as abutting sub-rects; every interior
# segment CROSS-EDGE is a constrained mesh edge whose ONLY nodes are the two
# corner vertices — both carrying the full crown drop (profile − rate·hw).
# The edge cuts FLAT ACROSS at the dropped altitude while the surface between
# segments carries the centerline ridge (crown_spine at profile) → the mesh
# dives from ridge to cross-edge and back at EVERY segment line = a visible
# centre DIP on every crowned runway.  Probe (CYXY base): 24 flat full-width
# interior cross-edges, 0 crowned.
#
# THE FIX (Phase 0 — does NOT de-segment): insert a CENTERLINE node at each
# interior cross-edge's axis intersection at the runway PROFILE altitude (crown
# drop 0 on the axis), into the rings of BOTH abutting sub-rects at the
# IDENTICAL midpoint so the emit consensus WELDS them into one node (a one-
# sided insert would mint a T-vertex/tear).  Each cross-section becomes a tent
# (corner-low → centre-high → corner-low) matching the crown.  Centre altitude
# = the persisted profile (runway_redistribute._interp_profile at the station)
# — the SAME source the crown_spine breakline uses, so the two constraints
# agree (no duplicate near-coincident constraint = the wedge class).
#
# ## LANDED (part 30i)
# 1. crown.insert_runway_crossedge_crown_nodes(layout) — the whole fix; called
#    as the ABSOLUTE-LAST geometry touch (pipeline, beside the probe-node hook,
#    after decimation / final projection / skirts; a mid-edge tent vertex is
#    the 3D-collinear class emit decimation removes, so it must arrive last).
#    Groups ROLE_RUNWAY sub-rects by ref; a canonical-edge shared by exactly 2
#    distinct sub-rects = an interior cross-edge (long / end edges belong to one
#    sub-rect, never shared → skipped by construction — ends read by skirts/
#    RESA are untouched).  Skips seam-band cross-edges (tile-seam pins are
#    cross-tile terrain contracts; tile_cut._SEAM_LINE_TOL_M).  Runway↔crossing
#    edges have <2 ROLE_RUNWAY owners → skipped (no one-sided insert; the
#    crossing dome already puts drop 0 on the axis).  Gate O4_RUNWAY_XEDGE_CROWN
#    (default 1); inherits ENABLE_SPINE_CROWN + CROWN_RUNWAYS.
# 2. VALIDATOR: the centerline nodes are exported to the axes sidecar
#    (layout.to_osm → "crown_centerline") and check_grade skips runway within-
#    shape all-pairs plane pairs that touch one (_crown_centerline_nids) —
#    exactly the crown_spine-breakline exemption class: a cross-station diagonal
#    to a ridge node conflates the LONGITUDINAL profile (the SPINE PROFILE
#    check's domain) with the sub-cap LATERAL crown.  Without this the extra
#    centerline samples on SPLP's at-cap runway tripped within 16→31 (same
#    marginal 1.6% class, just more pairs).  check_grade + verification.py +
#    tests/test_pavement_grade.py all thread the new field.
# 3. verification.check_runway_profile: reconstruct cross-ends from the runway
#    AXIS (cluster corners at the two extreme stations, take the EDGE elevation
#    = MIN of the cluster so the inserted ridge node is excluded) so a crowned
#    5+-corner sub-rect's longitudinal profile is still measured — else the
#    old ``len==4`` gate SKIPPED crowned rects and MASKED SPLP's real >1.5%
#    profile (test_runway_longitudinal_grade[SPLP] flipped to a false PASS).
#    Behaviour is byte-identical for uncrowned 4-corner rects (MIN==AVG at each
#    flat cross-end).
#
# ## VERIFIED (gates, part 30i — all at 136c6a0 baselines)
# * Cross-section probe (emitted OSM, sidecar-identified centerline nodes):
#   CYXY 24 tents (+0.12/+0.15/+0.23 m = the per-ref crown drops exactly),
#   SPLP 8 (+0.23), HECA 53 (+0.30), KCLT 4.  Baseline: 0 crowned, all flat.
#   Every crowned segment centre lifts by the crown drop above its edge corners.
# * check_grade: SPLP within 16 (== baseline), CYXY 1, HECA 0, KCLT 6; plane 0,
#   cross 0 everywhere; HECA vertex-to-edge 3 + mid-edge 14, break 5891 (the
#   quarantined-by-design class); SPINE PROFILE + skirt sections unchanged.
# * wedge_audit (uncommitted; NOT committed by this task): ZERO new wedges —
#   CYXY 2→2, SPLP 0→0, HECA 5→5.  No tear, no near-coincident duplicate.
# * O4_SPINE_CROWN=0 / O4_RUNWAY_XEDGE_CROWN=0: 0 cross-edges crowned (gated).
# * fast_suite: exactly the 8 pre-existing failures (identical set — the fix
#   RESOLVED none by masking; the verification.py cross-end fix keeps
#   test_runway_longitudinal_grade[SPLP] correctly RED).  Full suite: exactly
#   the 13 pre-existing failures.  Zero new.
# * Conformance invariant (SPLP 1 residual T-junction, HECA 13/3): IDENTICAL
#   base vs fix — pre-existing (the crown runs after conformance), not worsened.
#
# ## OPEN (part 30i follow-ups)
# * Runway↔runway_crossing interior cross-edges are NOT centre-crowned (only
#   ROLE_RUNWAY↔ROLE_RUNWAY pairs are).  The crossing dome already puts drop 0
#   on the axis, so a crossing-abutting cross-edge dips less; a full fix waits
#   for de-seg Phase 2 (the crossing becomes one welded ring).
# * The hotfix keeps segments; de-seg (Phases 1–3, docs/runway_single_polygon_
#   plan.md) still removes the interior cross-edges entirely.  This de-risks the
#   Monday deadline: the dips die now.

# STATUS — SESSION 20260707 (part 30j): KJQF EPSILON-WEDGE triangle
# explosion — final weld on the boundary↔groundside seam
# (1,993,832 → 14,252 isolated tris; +to_osm zero-edge guard + verify tripwire)

## LANDED (part 30j) — final epsilon-wedge weld + zero-length-edge guard
## + always-on wedge detector in the verify pass

THE DEFECT.  KJQF's fresh patch costs ~2.0M triangles (~55 % of tile
+35-081) via EPSILON WEDGES: two constrained edges share a node, run
near-parallel (< 0.01°), and diverge by sub-millimetre.  Triangle4XP's
Ruppert encroachment rule ping-pongs edge splits on the near-zero-area
sliver down to machine epsilon, exploding the tile.  MEASURED source:
the ``boundary`` ribbon and the ``groundside_pavement`` lots RE-DERIVE
the same physical outline with DIFFERENT vertex sets — a groundside lot
edge that runs ALONG the ribbon inner edge ends up with a ribbon vertex
sitting ON it (perp 0.0001–0.5 mm, projecting mid-edge) WITHOUT a shared
node.  21 such pairs at KJQF (way -10586 boundary ↔ -10177 groundside,
shared node -2183; boundary vertex -3574 sits 8.5 m along the 15.06 m
groundside edge -2183→-2184 at 0.00012 mm perpendicular).

NOT THE 30e/30f REGRESSION IT WAS FRAMED AS.  Measured control: KJQF at
787cb6a (pre-30e) = 26 wedges / 21 boundary~groundside, IDENTICAL to dev
136c6a0.  The 30e/30f diff (``boundary.py`` bridge↔skirt reconcile,
``clearance.py`` outer-edge lift + needle declaw) does NOT touch the
boundary/groundside OUTLINE path — the wedge class is a LONGSTANDING
structural issue, pre-dating 30d.  MECHANISM: the final T-vertex weld
``enforce_conformance(tol=0.01, include_overlay_refs=True)`` runs at
pipeline.py:5534, but THREE geometry-mutating passes run AFTER it —
``_separate_groundside_from_airside`` (rebuilds lot rings by re-sampling
the DEM-follow outline), ``decimate_emit_nodes`` (drops per-shape ring
vertices independently), and the runway-end skirts.  Those RE-DERIVE a
neighbour's outline with a fresh vertex set, DE-CONFORMING the seam the
5534 weld just welded.  (Decimation OFF makes KJQF WORSE — 53 wedges —
so decimation is not the cause; the independent outline re-sampling is.)

THE FIX (three parts).
 1. **Final epsilon-wedge weld** (``pipeline.py``, after the skirt emit /
    reconcile, before the O4_PROBE_NODES insert): re-run
    ``enforce_conformance(tol=0.01, include_overlay_refs=True)`` on the
    FINAL vertex sets so each on-edge foreign vertex is inserted into the
    edge it lies on → shared node → the sliver vanishes.  TIGHT 0.01 m
    tolerance (the wedge class sits at 0.000–0.003 m perp); a wider tol
    would bow edges / mint hairline overlaps.  Insert-only at interpolated
    altitudes (surface-neutral), safe as the last production geometry
    touch.  KJQF: inserts 11 vertices, kills all 21 boundary~groundside
    wedges.  No-op where there is no such seam (HECA 0, SPLP 0, CYXY 0).
 2. **Zero-length-edge guard** (``layout.py`` ``_ring_to_nids``): two ring
    vertices at the SAME canonical XY but Δalt > VERTEX_ALT_MERGE_TOL_M
    get DIFFERENT node ids (a wall/cliff) — but a wall cannot have zero
    horizontal extent, so a 0.00 m constrained edge results (KJQF
    taxiway_clearance -3870→-3871, Δalt 4.2 m).  Collapse consecutive
    (and the wrap-around closing) same-coordinate nids to the first-kept
    vertex.  KJQF near-zero segments 1 → 0.
 3. **Wedge detector in the verify pass** (``verification.py``
    ``check_epsilon_wedges`` + wired into ``verify_and_log`` counts +
    debug lines as ``epsilon_wedge`` / ``EPSILON-WEDGE``): the always-on
    regression tripwire so a future emitter that mints a fresh unwelded
    outline is flagged per-airport.  Mirrors ``tools/wedge_audit.py``
    (committed, now CLI-capable: ``wedge_audit.py file.osm [--lat N]``).

## VERIFIED (gates, part 30j)
* WEDGE AUDIT (< 0.5°, < 20 cm, > 0), fresh builds in this worktree —
  boundary~groundside class ELIMINATED everywhere:
    KJQF  26 → 5   (was 21 boundary~groundside + 5 junction; now 5 junction)
    KCLT  15 → 12  (junction~runway/junction — a DIFFERENT emitter)
    HECA   5 → 5   (no boundary~groundside; unchanged, fix is a no-op)
    SPLP   0 → 0
    CYXY   2 → 2   (junction~runway 104 mm/0.11° — real geometry, unchanged)
  The residual junction/​runway wedges are NOT the boundary/groundside
  regression: they are bound to the solved slice-partition geometry (the
  part-30g negative result — junction faces cannot be merged/moved without
  breaking elevation neutrality) and the tight weld cannot reach them
  without bowing solved constrained edges.  DOCUMENTED, not fixed, per
  this task's "fix if weld-reuse covers them, else document" scope.
* ISOLATED TRIANGULATION (/tmp/meshdiag, frame + patch + real tile .alt):
    KJQF  1,993,832 → 14,252 tris   (gate < 15K — MET; −99.3 %)
    KCLT    145,260 → 130,614 tris  (gate ≤ 200K — MET)
    HECA     44,810 → 44,810 tris   (gate ≈ 40K — byte-identical, no-op)
* check_grade at gate baselines: WITHIN-SHAPE SPLP **16**, CYXY **1**,
  HECA **0**; RUNWAY-END SKIRT edge / PLANE GRADIENT / CROSS-SHAPE all
  **0** everywhere; HECA steps **3 + 14** (unchanged).  (KJQF WITHIN
  8 → 11: the 11 newly-welded T-vertices add a few sub-2 % within-shape
  pairs — KJQF is not a check_grade gate airport; SPLP/CYXY/HECA gates
  hold exactly.)
* HECA clearance_spike_audit **48 samples / 37 clusters** (≤ 48/37 gate —
  the 30f fixes stay fixed).
* tools/fast_suite.sh: exactly the **8** pre-existing failures
  (SPLP compare×2 + grade×2, CYXY×3, SPLP/CYXY grade — identical IDs).
  Full suite: exactly the **13** pre-existing (SPLP×4, SPJC×4, CYXY×4,
  HECA×1) — no new failures.  test_layout + test_verification_checks: 35
  pass (the to_osm guard + verify wiring green).

## OPEN (part 30j follow-ups)
* Residual junction~junction / junction~runway wedges (KJQF 5, KCLT 12,
  HECA 3–5) — a SEPARATE emitter (the curve-native global slice partition,
  part 30g).  They do NOT explode the mesh at KCLT (130K, under gate) —
  the boundary/groundside class was the only ~2M driver — but a
  slice-partition fix (fewer/larger junction faces, per-face profiles
  re-solved on the coarser partition) would clear them.  Out of this
  task's "don't touch the solver/slice" scope; tracked as 30g's
  recommended follow-up.
* The final weld is the LAST production geometry touch.  O4_PROBE_NODES
  (opt-in, normally unset) inserts vertices AFTER it and would re-introduce
  on-edge nodes — acceptable, since probes are a diagnostic-only path.


# STATUS — SESSION 20260707 (part 30f): in-sim CLEARANCE defect fixes —
# sunk-pavement outer-edge WALL + resample NEEDLES + tighter standoff
# (HECA/CYXY in-sim eval: terrain spikes at jogs, pointy cuts, deep notch)

## LANDED (part 30f) — clearance cuts hug pavement + daylight as a
## backslope instead of walling off; single-vertex spikes clamped
USER REPORTS (in-sim, HECA "looks great" otherwise; CYXY):
 1+2. HECA 30.1165887,31.4109619 / 30.1166179,31.4111917 — terrain
    spikes at little jogs in clearance shapes.
 3.   HECA 30.0974775,31.4075072 — three POINTY cuts misaligned with the
    pavement they follow.
 4.   CYXY 60.7121148,-135.0702708 — a strange DEEP NOTCH in a clearance
    shape.
 5.   Cuts should hug the pavement — reduce the margin more.
 6.   CYXY 60.7092306,-135.0738928 — service-road spine "big ridge"
    (DIAGNOSE ONLY).

ROOT CAUSE (one class for 1–4).  The Pass A3 flat-shadow cut cuts terrain
above the pavement-edge ceiling down to it and DAYLIGHTS where the DEM
drops back to the ceiling.  But where the pavement is SUNK in a plateau
(HECA apron/service-road corridors excavated ~14 m below grade; the CYXY
14R/32L NW threshold at 694 m in 715 m terrain) the terrain NEVER drops
back to the ceiling within the band cap.  The outer daylight edge then
planted a FLAT shelf at pavement level under 14 m of standing terrain — a
vertical WALL at the band edge (items 1/2/4, the "spike at a jog" / "deep
notch") and a submerged shelf whose corners splay past the pavement at
convex jogs (item 3, the "pointy cuts").

FIX A — outer-edge lift-only (``_build_graded_strips``): the outer
(daylight) row rides the HIGHER of the ceiling and the DEM — the exact
mirror of the skirt's ``_skirt_lift_alt`` convention.  Where terrain has
daylit this is the ceiling (unchanged); where it has not, the outer edge
rides UP to meet the standing terrain as a cut BACKSLOPE instead of a
wall.  Only ever RAISES the outer edge → never carves a sub-surface
canyon (the CLEARANCE_LATERAL_MAX_SLOPE=0 canyon guard is preserved).

FIX B — needle declaw (``_declaw_alt_needles``, ``_NEEDLE_ALT_TOL_M`` =
3 m).  Fix A makes the inner edge ride pavement level and the outer edge
ride terrain, so at a concave jog of a thin sunk-pavement corridor the
inner and outer SOURCE strip edges pass within the resampler's
``EDGE_TOL_M`` (0.5 m); one final-ring vertex flips to the far edge and
spikes ~7 m above/below its neighbours (a single-vertex needle — the
residual in-sim spike).  ``_finalize`` clamps any vertex differing from
BOTH ring neighbours by > 3 m (neighbours agreeing to within 3 m) to the
neighbour mean — the LAST altitude op before emit + the ``adopt`` seam
store, so a spike from resample, sibling adoption OR the coincident-vertex
merge is removed and never propagates.  (HECA: fix A alone introduced 6
needles; declaw → 0.  CYXY had 3 needles at BASELINE → 0.)

FIX C — item 5, tighter standoff: ``_PAVEMENT_GAP_M`` 1.5 → 1.0 m,
``_RING_PROBE_M`` 2.0 → 1.5 m.  Still 2× the 0.5 m merge / edge-proximity
floor (``SHARED_VERTEX_TOL_M`` = ``check_vertex_on_sloping_edge``
``EDGE_PROX_M`` = 0.5), so the inner edge never lands on or merges with
pavement.  Verified: HECA min cut-vertex-to-pavement 0.751 m, 0 vertices
within 0.5 m; CROSS-SHAPE (≤0.5 m) grade = 0 at all airports.

## VERIFIED (gates, part 30f — all at f9d5103 baselines)
* ``clearance_spike_audit`` HECA **205 → 48 samples / 37 clusters** (well
  under the 203/119 gate — the tighter standoff halves the deliberate
  pavement-gap crack band).  CYXY **487/122 → 220/57**.  SPLP 19/7.  The
  three reported HECA spots + the CYXY notch are covered (nearest residual
  6.4 m from HECA coord-1, a 2-sample crack beside a service road sunk
  6.5 m — mesh-constrained, inherent to sunk pavement).
* Per-site: CYXY notch max cut ring-edge grade **38 % (1.4 m/3.7 m wall)
  → 2 % (0.9 m/58.8 m smooth backslope)**; notch cut alt range 694–708 →
  694–716 (rides up to terrain).  HECA coord-1 needle 6.9 m (fix-A only)
  → 0.  All 4 coords inside clean cuts, 0 needles (thr 3 m) across HECA +
  CYXY.
* check_grade at f9d5103 baselines: WITHIN SPLP **16**, CYXY **1**, HECA
  **0**; PLANE 0, CROSS 0, RUNWAY-END SKIRT edge 0 everywhere; HECA steps
  3 + 14 (unchanged).
* fast_suite.sh: exactly the 8 pre-existing failures (identical test IDs
  to a stashed f9d5103 run).  Full suite: exactly the 13 pre-existing
  (SPLP×4, SPJC×4, CYXY×4, HECA×1) — no new failures.

## ITEM 6 VERDICT (DIAGNOSE ONLY) — STALE-BAKE ARTIFACT
CYXY service-road spine "big ridge" at 60.7092306,-135.0738928: HEAD
emits NOTHING elevated there.  ``CROWN_SERVICE`` defaults OFF (config.py:
runway-only crown scoping since 1ed5cc6); all 8 ``crown_spine`` breaklines
in the HEAD CYXY patch are RUNWAY spines (z 693–706, nearest 481 m from
the site).  The service_road (-10204) at the site follows DEM (res ≈ 0,
no transverse ridge); the service_junction (-10065) 4 m spread is
LONGITUDINAL (road descends 709→705 along its length).  The user's tile
predates the crown scoping — a RE-BAKE clears the ridge.

## OPEN (part 30f follow-ups)
* The sunk-pavement corridors (HECA 30.115–30.116, service roads/apron
  ~14 m below a plateau; CYXY 14R/32L NW threshold) still carry a
  mesh-constrained crack-band residual (a few 1–2-sample audit clusters)
  where the pavement edge itself abuts 6–14 m of standing terrain — the
  cut inner edge MUST sit at pavement level for wingtip protection, so the
  step at the pavement/cut boundary is inherent, not a cut defect.  If it
  ever needs closing, the pavement solver (not the clearance sweep) is the
  place — the pavement is genuinely dug in.
* Reducing ``_PAVEMENT_GAP_M`` below 1.0 m would approach the 0.5 m merge
  floor; 1.0 is the practical minimum with the current tolerances.



# STATUS — SESSION 20260707 (part 30g): KCLT junction mesh-density — the
# fix does NOT live emit-side; the triangles are bound to the solved
# constrained-edge geometry (measured, negative result)

## VERDICT
KCLT's junction triangle load resists every EMIT-SIDE reduction that
respects the elevation / law / conformance invariants.  The target
(full patch 144K → <80K, junction class ~125K → <60K, HECA held at 40K)
is NOT reachable by ring decimation or parallel-sliver merge as scoped.
The triangles are inextricably bound to the constrained-edge geometry
that ENCODES the solved elevation field: you cannot remove the tris
without removing constrained edges, and removing them either changes the
surface (breaks elevation neutrality) or breaks the conformance invariant
the pipeline maintains at a delicate equilibrium.  No behavior-changing
code was committed — this entry is the durable finding.

## MECHANISM (isolated-triangulation harness, /tmp/meshdiag, f9d5103)
Baselines (frame-box + patch through Triangle4XP with the tile's CLI
params, real +35-081 / +30+031 .alt):

    KCLT full 144,264 · no-junction 19,522 · JUNCTION CLASS 124,742
    HECA full  40,098 · no-junction 23,420 · JUNCTION CLASS  16,678

KCLT junctions IN COMPLETE ISOLATION (frame + junction ways only) cost
47,070 tris (639 ways); HECA 20,948 (400 ways).  So of the 125K
"junction-class" cost, only ~47K is the junctions' own triangulation —
the other ~78K is refinement junctions INDUCE in the neighbours they
squeeze against (apron / *_clearance / crown_spine).  Proof: dropping any
ONE neighbour class alone barely moves the count (all ≈140K), but
dropping junction + all its neighbours → 12,228.  It is a COUPLED
constrained-edge system; the interfaces are the cost.

WHY KCLT ≫ HECA: fragmentation + packing, not node count.  KCLT has 639
junction faces in 1.6M m² (median 586 m²); HECA 400 faces in 2.5M m²
(median 496).  KCLT packs 60% MORE faces into 36% LESS area, so its
shared-boundary edges are shorter and denser (1397 shared-edge pairs vs
HECA 899).  Triangle4XP's -q10 (10° min-angle) quality mesh refines every
thin region between densely-interleaved constrained edges into needle
triangles.  Top hotspot: one 55 m cell holds 14,709 tris where junction
faces -10339/-10340 (542×79 m and 305×79 m, 55-59 nodes) run 2.8 m apart
with a 30 m² filler sliver (-10719) wedged between; a second cell holds
9,521 where two junctions sit 2.3 m apart.

DEFINITIVE lever check: dissolving the 639 junction faces into their 14
connected-component UNIONS (removing internal shared boundaries) drops
junction-only cost 47,070 → 6,912 (nodes 7,967 → 1,339).  The internal
constrained edges ARE the driver.  But those edges carry the per-face
solved profiles — dissolving merges floors (violates elevation
neutrality) and, in the full patch, the dissolved rings pinch against the
un-merged neighbours → 3.16M tris (degenerate).

## LEVERS MEASURED (all fall short or are unsafe)
- Decimation Z band 0.02→0.15 m (global): 143,924 → 126,804 (−17K).  Far
  short of 80K, and 0.15 m reintroduces the V15 waviness the 0.02 m band
  was tuned to suppress.  Junction-SCOPED would yield even less.
- Densification OFF (O4_DENSIFY_JUNCTION_EDGES=0): 143,924 → 142,388
  (−1.5K).  Densification is NOT the driver.  Short edges (<12 m) already
  get zero densification (densify_junction_edges k=0).
- Coarser spine step (O4_JCT_SPINE_STEP_M=24): 183,172 — WORSE.  Fewer
  edge nodes = bigger gaps for the interior refinement to fill.
- apt-zone density WEIGHT off (harness weight_on=False): 140,140 (−4K).
  The ×4 apt weight is not the driver; the constrained geometry is.
- Elongated-sliver removal (77 faces, area<300, aspect≥3): 143,924 →
  128,962 (−15K) but DESTRUCTIVE (uncovers pavement) — not a real fix.
- Sliver-merge with SPINE VETO OFF (O4_SLIVER_SPINE_VETO=0): build HUNG
  (killed after 8 min; normal build 140 s).  The veto is load-bearing:
  unvetoed unions produce degenerate geometry a downstream pass thrashes
  on.  With the veto ON, KCLT merges 0 (all 179 candidates spine-vetoed —
  their shared edge IS a slice-cut spine line whose nodes carry the solved
  profile; the veto guards exactly the elevation fidelity this task must
  not break).
- Post-hoc edge surgery (snap 3226 gap vertices onto foreign edges;
  buffer-union merge): both → 3.16M tris.  Any edge op done OUTSIDE the
  pipeline's weld/conformance machinery mints self-intersections /
  zero-area slivers that triangulate catastrophically.  Confirms the
  geometry sits at a conformance equilibrium.

## WHERE THE TRIANGLES RESIST (one line)
The 47K junction-own + 78K induced load lives in the shared-boundary and
near-parallel-gap edges between KCLT's densely-packed junction faces.
Collapsing them needs a SOURCE-side change — the curve-native global
slice emitting FEWER, LARGER junction faces (KCLT 639 vs HECA 400 for
less area), with per-face profiles re-solved on the coarser partition —
NOT an emit-side ring/geometry edit.  That is a solver/slice-partition
change (out of this task's "don't touch solver / re-solve elevations"
scope) and would flip compare-target floor counts.  Recommend routing the
real fix through the slice partition (pavement/global_slice.py +
junction classification), gated, with the compare-target fixtures re-cut
deliberately — tracked as a follow-up, not an emit hotfix.

## HARNESS (rebuilt/verified this session — the gate)
/tmp/meshdiag/isolate.py (+ isolate_file.py, isolate_only.py,
isolate_noweight.py) replicate include_patches() insertion + the O4 mesh
CLI against the real tile .alt.  patch_stats.py / needle2.py /
parallel.py / subseg.py / coplanar.py / hotspot.py characterise the
junction class.  ISO_LAT/ISO_LON/ISO_ALT env select the tile.

# STATUS — SESSION 20260707 (part 30e): runway-end SKIRT lift-only fix +
# boundary→DEM BRIDGE ↔ skirt/RESA reconciliation (KCLT 18R in-sim ramp)

## LANDED (part 30e) — skirt is FILL-only (never cuts), bridge matches skirt
USER REPORT (in-sim, KCLT 18R): a ramp carved BELOW grade at a runway
end.  Two causes, both fixed:

### A. Skirt lift-only (fill never cuts — the flat-shadow mirror)
The runway-end skirt (``clearance.emit_runway_end_skirts``) enforces a
MINIMUM grade: it FILLS terrain that falls too steeply below the law
floor (``grade_law.runway_end_skirt_floor_profile``); the RESA cut
(Pass C) separately handles terrain that RISES.  The skirt must be
FILL-ONLY, but it emitted vertex altitudes at the analytic floor
UNCONDITIONALLY — so terrain inside a triggered band that sits ABOVE the
floor (a bump in a hollow; the last+step daylight overshoot) was graded
DOWN to the floor: an unnecessary cut ramp.

FIX — per-vertex lift-only, ``skirt_alt = max(analytic_floor, DEM)``, via
ONE shared helper ``clearance._skirt_lift_alt`` at all three emit sites:
``_build_filled_skirts`` ring altitudes (inner + outer rows) AND the two
analytic ``alt_at`` closures (``_end_alt_at``, ``_flank_alt_at``, now
closing over ``sample_dem``) used when the finalize clip recomputes
vertices.  Mirrors the cut passes' flat-shadow convention (cuts never
fill; fills never cut — docs/STANDARDS.md "Lateral (wingtip) clearance").
Shared band-boundary rows compute the SAME max'ed value at shared
vertices (identical position + DEM sample + rounding) → no surface tear.

VALIDATOR lockstep (``tools/check_grade._check_runway_end_skirt_edges``):
the DEM-free edge-grade reader assumed level band rows and flagged any
edge steeper than the down-grade cap.  Lift breaks levelness — a bump
vertex descending to a floor vertex can exceed the cap LAWFULLY (the law
bounds how far BELOW the floor, not how the surface rides a bump back
up).  DEM-free we cannot read the floor, but we tell lawful-lift from
corruption by SHAPE: a lift RAISES a vertex above its ring neighbours (a
peak); post-emit corruption DROPS one below them (a valley).  The reader
now skips an over-steep edge whose HIGHER endpoint is a local peak (a
lifted DEM bump) and still flags genuine over-steep descents.  The
DEM-aware ``verification.check_runway_end_skirt`` remains the full
below-floor law check (unaffected by lift — lifting only RAISES the
surface, which can never read as a below-floor drop).

NOTE (measured): at SPLP (6 skirts) and KCLT (48 skirts, 4392 emit-time
skirt vertices) NO skirt vertex has DEM above the analytic floor, so the
lift is a no-op there (before == after == 0 down-cutting vertices).  The
fix is a correctness guarantee for bump terrain; the VISIBLE 18R ramp was
cause B.

### B. Boundary→DEM bridge ↔ skirt/RESA reconciliation
The boundary→DEM bridge emits in the feature phase, BEFORE the final
grade projection and the skirts (which are the absolute-LAST emission —
they bake the floor from the settled pavement profile; the KCLT 18L
+0.4 m case in the skirt call-site comment).  So a bridge at a runway
end anchors its inner edge to RAW DEM and cannot match the skirt/RESA
surface emitted later → the two meet in a step (KCLT 18R: **10.2 m**
bridge-vs-skirt mismatch — the ramp the user saw).

FIX (option b, contained — the skirt STAYS last): new
``boundary._reconcile_boundary_bridges_with_skirts``, called right after
the skirt emit + tile-cut in ``pipeline.py``.  Per bridge it (1)
SUBTRACTS any overlapped skirt/RESA (role ``runway_clearance``) area —
the skirt owns the graded terrain in its governed zone — then (2)
RE-ANCHORS every surviving bridge vertex within 8 m of a skirt/RESA
surface to that surface's edge-interpolated altitude, so bridge and
skirt meet FLUSH.  (Bridge + skirt are separated by the skirt's
pavement-gap/clip buffer, so they ABUT rather than overlap — the
re-anchor, not the subtraction, closes the step.)  Reuses the
``_clip_boundary_bridges_against_pavement`` difference + largest-piece +
``_resample_node_altitudes_nn`` machinery.  Option (a) (move bridge emit
after skirts) rejected: wide blast radius (bridge feeds snap-to-corner,
junction-contact insertion, tile-cut, feature conformance) and it fights
the skirt-must-be-last invariant.

## VERIFIED (gates, part 30e — all at 787cb6a baselines)
* KCLT **18R** (primary probe): bridge-vs-skirt mismatch **10.20 m → 0.00
  m**; 2 bridges reconciled, all 8 bridges preserved (not destroyed).
* Down-cutting skirt vertices (DEM−alt > 1 cm): SPLP 0→0, KCLT 0→0 (see
  NOTE above — lift is a no-op at these airports; verified at emit time
  over 4392 KCLT skirt vertices, 0 above-floor).
* check_grade (gate-on builds, all fixes): WITHIN-SHAPE SPLP **16**, CYXY
  **1**, HECA **0**; "RUNWAY-END SKIRT edge grade" **0** at SPLP / CYXY /
  HECA / KCLT (checker updated, still flags genuine over-steep — 3
  reader unit tests green).
* ``verification.check_runway_end_skirt`` at KCLT: **0** findings (skirt
  law conformance preserved; the KCLT M4 baseline holds).
* fast_suite.sh: exactly the 8 pre-existing failures.
* full suite: exactly the 13 pre-existing failures (SPLP ×4, SPJC ×4,
  CYXY ×4, HECA ×1) — no new failures.

## OPEN (part 30e follow-ups)
* The lift-only fix has no observable effect at the current fixtures (no
  above-floor skirt vertices).  A synthetic bump-in-band terrain confirms
  the emitter lifts and the checker no longer false-flags (143.7 % edge
  → 0 flags), but a REAL airport with a bump inside a triggered band
  would be the true regression witness — none in the fixture set.
* Bridge re-anchor tolerance is 8 m (one skirt station step + slack).  A
  bridge vertex >8 m from any skirt edge keeps its DEM value; if a future
  airport has a bridge frontier coarser than that, widen the tol.

# STATUS — SESSION 20260707 (part 30d): TAXIWAY-EDGE grade adoption for
# service roads (USER RULING part-29 item 4) — mirrors the apron-edge rule

## LANDED (part 30d) — taxiway-edge service-road grade adoption
USER RULING (2026-07-07, durable law, STATUS part 29 item 4): like the
existing APRON-edge adoption, the PORTION of a service road that is
INSIDE or SHARES A LONG EDGE with a TAXIWAY follows the more limiting
(taxiway) grade law — 1.5 % (letter-aware) instead of the road's 5 %.
Only isolated narrow-road stretches (nothing along their long edge) keep
the full road cap.  PORTION-based: split at the band boundary, exactly
like the apron-edge rule.

MECHANISM (extended the part-28 apron-edge adoption end-to-end; same shape):
1. **Pipeline pass** (``pipeline.py``, immediately AFTER the apron-edge
   pass): taxiway band = union of the taxi family (``ROLE_JUNCTION`` +
   the 4 taxi-rect roles: primary/secondary_parallel, stub,
   cross_connector) buffered ``SERVICE_ROAD_WIDTH_M + 2 m`` (join_style=2)
   — the SAME band construction the apron rule uses.  Eligible
   ``service_road``/``service_junction`` shapes that SHARE ≥1 m of the
   taxi boundary OR OVERLAP taxi pavement (inside) are split at the band:
   inside pieces set ``adopts_taxi_grade=True`` + ``adopted_taxi_letter``
   (the nearest taxi shape's ICAO code letter); outside pieces keep the
   service law.  Wholly-inside/alongside → adopts whole.  APRON (1 %) is
   MORE limiting than taxi (1.5 %), so the pass runs after the apron pass
   and SKIPS any piece already ``adopts_apron_grade`` (apron wins).
2. **Flag** (``layout.py`` ``BuiltShape``): new ``adopts_taxi_grade`` +
   ``adopted_taxi_letter`` (parallel to ``adopts_apron_grade``; existing
   apron flag + all its consumers untouched → backward compatible).
3. **Solver caps**: ``_shape_grade`` (solver_primitives), ``_body_cap``
   (grade_graph), the sloping-rect cap path, and the GradeShape
   propagation all resolve ``adopts_taxi_grade`` →
   ``taxi_grade_cap_for_letter(adopted_taxi_letter)`` (None → 1.5 %
   ``TAXI_MAX_GRADE``).  Apron branch checked first so apron wins.
4. **Emission tag** (``layout.to_osm``): ``o4_grade_law='taxi'`` (+
   ``code_letter`` for the letter-aware cap) on adopted pieces.
5. **Validator** (``tools/check_grade.py``): ``o4_grade_law='taxi'`` →
   ``taxi_grade_cap_for_letter(code_letter)`` in ``get_grade_limit``, and
   the OSM GradeShape reader propagates the flag + letter so solver and
   validator read the SAME cap.
6. **Fragment plumbing**: ``elevation.py`` extra-fragment rebuild carries
   the new fields (mirrors the apron flag).

## VERIFIED (gates, part 30d)
* PROBE (CYXY + HECA, smoothed-DEM cached build = the test frame):
  - CYXY: 1 adopted whole + 1 split; the 1 surviving adopted piece
    (service_junction) emits ``o4_grade_law='taxi'`` and SOLVES at
    1.46 % (≤ 1.5 %).  Its 15 ISOLATED sibling road pieces still grade up
    to the full 5.00 % cap (portion split works).
  - HECA: 5 adopted whole + 10 split; 6 surviving adopted pieces (4
    service_junction + 2 service_road) all emit ``o4_grade_law='taxi'``
    and SOLVE at 1.43 / 1.37 / 1.27 / 1.00 / 0.90 / 0.68 % (all ≤ 1.5 %).
    40 isolated road pieces still grade to 5 %+ (max 13.6 % over steep
    terrain — correctly UNcapped, no long taxi edge).
* NON-REGRESSION (baseline 1ed5cc6 vs this change, same measurement):
  within CYXY 1→1, HECA 0→0, SPLP 16→16; cross/steps IDENTICAL
  (HECA cross 10, vertex-to-edge 3 + mid-edge 14).  Break-region
  growth tiny: CYXY 772→779 (+0.9 %), HECA 11067→11084 (+0.15 %) — both
  well under the +2 % watch threshold; NO new within violations on any
  adopted road.  No infeasible pocket surfaced (adopted pieces sit inside
  the already-flattened taxi solve; the apron rule's mouth/band
  exemptions were NOT needed).
* fast_suite: EXACTLY the 8 pre-existing failures, zero new.
* FULL suite: EXACTLY the 13 pre-existing failures
  (splp compare ×2, pavement_grade SPLP, runway_longitudinal SPLP,
  compare_spjc, no_self_overlap SPJC, pavement_grade SPJC,
  cyxy_taxi_e_south_apron, route_band_zero SPJC, pavement_grade CYXY,
  cyxy_route_reach, solver_validator_same_edge_budgets,
  pavement_grade HECA), zero new.

## OPEN (part 30d follow-ups)
* A standalone taxi-adopted ``service_road`` piece (not in PAVEMENT_ROLES
  nor SOFT_VISIBILITY_ROLES) has no direct solver within-shape
  constraint — like the apron rule, its 1.5 % is enforced at the
  VALIDATOR (``o4_grade_law='taxi'``) and inherited from the flattened
  taxi solve its vertices sit in.  Held at HECA (0.68-0.90 %); if a future
  airport puts an adopted road over steep terrain WITHOUT a co-solved
  taxi host it could read over-cap — same latent property the apron rule
  carries.  Would need service_road in PAVEMENT_ROLES to solve-enforce.

# STATUS — SESSION 20260707 (part 30c): CROWN runway-only scoping +
# runway-crossing drainage-dome blend + continuous crossing ridge
# (in-sim crown eval iteration; builds on part 30/30b crown v2)

## LANDED (part 30c) — runway-only crown + crossing blend
USER DIRECTIVE (in-sim, testing crowns): crown RUNWAYS ONLY this
iteration; blend crowns at every runway intersection so centerlines
cross at the same elevation and edges meet smoothly; emit BOTH ridges
continuously through the crossing.  The taxi/service crown code is KEPT
INTACT (evaluation scoping, not removal).

1. **FAMILY SCOPING** (config.py: ``CROWN_RUNWAYS`` / ``CROWN_TAXI`` /
   ``CROWN_SERVICE``, env ``O4_CROWN_{RUNWAYS,TAXI,SERVICE}``; default
   runways-only = 1/0/0; ``ENABLE_SPINE_CROWN`` stays the master gate).
   ``build_crown_drop_field`` gates each family's eligibility on its
   flag; ``runway_crown_drop_m`` returns 0 when runways de-scoped.
   A de-scoped family's nodes carry c = 0.  ``emit_crown_spines`` skips
   a family's ridge when that family is off.  All taxi/service code
   paths remain — re-enable with the env flags.
2. **RUNWAY-CROSSING DRAINAGE DOME** (crown.py ``_crossing_blend_axes``
   + ``_crossing_dome_drop``): inside a crossing influence zone (a
   runway node with ≥2 member axes within ``_XING_INFLUENCE_M`` = 40 m)
   the uniform per-ref drop is replaced by
   ``drop(p) = min_r RUNWAY_CROWN_TRANSVERSE × min(perp_dist_to_axis_r,
   hw_cap_r)`` — 0 on either centerline (both ridges pass through at
   profile level), rising to the min member half-width in the quadrants.
   Outside the zone the node keeps the plain uniform drop (profile
   reconstruction stays simple); the two regimes agree at the boundary
   (an own-edge node ≥ hw_cap from every foreign axis evaluates to its
   own uniform drop → no transition step).  Runway-shadow adoption uses
   the dome at the crossing so shadowed corridor nodes meet the blended
   edge.
3. **CONTINUOUS CROSSING RIDGE** (crown.py runway spine loop): each
   runway ref's axis is now clipped against the UNION of its
   ROLE_RUNWAY pieces + every ROLE_RUNWAY_CROSSING it belongs to, so the
   ridge is ONE continuous breakline THROUGH the crossing (closes the
   v2 gap item).  Both members' ridges meet where the centerlines cross
   (equal altitude per the reconciliation, #4).
4. **CENTERLINE EQUALITY VERIFIED, untouched**: the runway_segments
   centerline-crossing reconciliation already forces both profiles to
   the same ``agreed`` altitude at the crossing.  Probe (CYXY
   02/20×14R/32L): profile[02/20] = profile[14R/32L] = 694.0769,
   DELTA = 0.00 cm.  Not modified.
5. **READERS** (part 30 field/sidecar unchanged): crossing-adjacent
   nodes export their per-node dome value via ``_crown_drop_ll`` →
   sidecar ``crown_drops`` (CYXY runway-only histogram: 0.081/0.113/
   0.114/0.115/0.13/0.147 blended values alongside 0.12/0.15/0.23 per-
   ref uniforms) and the in-memory ``_crown_drop_key`` both readers
   share.  Invariant held: c single-valued per canonical node, 0 at
   seam pins.
6. **RUNWAY WINS over de-scoped-family freeze** (crown.py: new
   ``descoped_frozen`` set): a runway edge vertex SHARED with a
   de-scoped junction was frozen at c = 0 by the junction, leaving the
   runway's own edge stepping at the weld (7.3 % at SPLP).  Now a
   de-scoped crown-family freeze yields to a co-owning runway's drop
   (genuine non-crown owners — apron/terminal/building/boundary/
   groundside — still hard-freeze).  Runway now crowns ALL 22/23 of its
   SPLP ring vertices (was 11).
7. **``extend_field_to_new_ring_nodes`` bug fix**: a post-solve ring
   insert with BOTH flanks uncrowned got a spurious ≤5 cm drop (ring
   non-planarity read as crown; surfaced once taxi de-scoped).  Now
   inserts with ``c_max == 0`` inherit no drop.

## VERIFIED (gates, part 30c)
* Crossing (CYXY, ``tools/full_airport_build.py`` + probes):
  (a) both profiles at the crossing = 694.0769, ≤ 2 cm ✓;
  (b) crown_spine ridge CONTINUOUS through both crossings on both
  centerlines (crossing 1: 02/20 7 on-axis verts @694.06-694.11,
  14R/32L 6 @694.07-694.09; crossing 2: 02/20 6 @693.68-693.73,
  14L/32R 5 @693.72-693.73) ✓;
  (c) quadrant edge nodes carry the min-formula dome (transect
  perpendicular through the crossing: 0.06 cm on the crossed centerline,
  rising smoothly and monotonically to the 11.5 cm cap at the edges) ✓;
  (d) check_grade: within 1 (known apron-#29), cross 0, plane 0,
  steps 0 ✓.
* Runway-only gating: SPLP within 16 (IDENTICAL pairs to gate-off,
  values uniformly lower by the drop), CYXY within 1, HECA within 0;
  plane/cross 0 all three; HECA vertex-to-edge 3 + mid-edge 14 steps
  IDENTICAL to gate-off; HECA break 5888 (gate-off 5824, all-crown
  5895 — quarantined-by-design class).  taxi/service crowned-node count
  drops CYXY 1170 → 112 (0 taxi/junction/service ring keys carry a drop
  beyond runway shadows); only runway ridges emit.
* O4_SPINE_CROWN=0: SPLP + CYXY patches BYTE-IDENTICAL to HEAD gate-off.
* All-families path preserved (O4_CROWN_TAXI=1 O4_CROWN_SERVICE=1):
  CYXY within 1, 1156 crowned nodes (was 1170; the extend-field fix
  removed spurious inserts), taxi ridge emission unchanged (1 at CYXY —
  narrow corridors eroded by the 1 m inner clearance, pre-existing);
  runway ridges now 8 continuous ways (was 31 per-piece fragments).
* fast_suite: EXACTLY the 8 pre-existing failures.  Full suite: the 13
  pre-existing failures exactly.  Zero new.

## OPEN (part 30c follow-ups)
* ``_XING_INFLUENCE_M`` = 40 m is a fixed reach; if a future airport has
  a very oblique or very wide crossing the zone may want to key off the
  member half-widths instead of a constant.
* Taxi/service ridge emission is sparse at narrow airports (the 1 m
  ``_SPINE_EDGE_CLEAR_M`` inner buffer erodes thin corridors) — a
  pre-existing property, only relevant when taxi/service crown is
  re-enabled.

## LANDED (part 30) — crown v2, the agreed architecture
The v1 post-solve edge-drop module is GONE (crown.py rewritten; the
pipeline "SPINE CROWN" block removed).  The crown is now built INSIDE
the construction, one mechanism for runways + taxiways + service roads:

1. **CROWN DROP FIELD** (``crown.build_crown_drop_field``, the single
   source both readers consume): per-CANONICAL-NODE designed drop c ≥ 0.
   * runway / runway_crossing rings: UNIFORM per-ref drop
     ``profiles[ref]['crown_drop_m'] = RUNWAY_CROWN_TRANSVERSE ×
     min(half_width, 30 m)`` (persisted by redistribute; crossings take
     the min over member refs; shared keys min over refs — uniformity
     keeps the reconstructed longitudinal profile untouched), axially
     TAPERED at 1 % toward tile-seam vertices;
   * taxi/service corridor nodes: ``rate × min(lateral-to-nearest-
     same-family-centerline, half_width cap 12 m taxi / 4 m service)``,
     0 on the spine itself (≤ 1 m tol), MIN over owning families;
   * RUNWAY SHADOW: an eligible node ≤ 2.5 m from a crowned runway is
     value-tied to its edge (vertex-push standoff, edge-plane stamps,
     join anchors) → carries the RUNWAY's drop;
   * frozen at c = 0: any non-crown owner (apron/terminal/building/
     boundary/groundside/adopts_apron_grade), tile-seam buckets, seam
     pins, building seats, groundside mouth welds, seam spine anchors;
     4-corner rect rings equalize (min) so planes stay planes.
2. **SOLVER**: the whole route-profile solve runs in UNCROWNED space
   z' = z + c — byte-identical to the pre-crown solve — and the
   WRITEBACK emits z = z' − c (solve.py; same transform wrapped around
   ``final_grade_projection``: add c after seeding, subtract before its
   writeback).  c is single-valued per canonical node ⇒ welds can never
   tear; no freeze sets, no vetoes, no revoke valve.  Post-solve ring
   inserts (planarize / T-welds) join the field VALUE-DERIVED
   (``crown.extend_field_to_new_ring_nodes``: z'-lerp of solve-time
   flanks minus the insert's value; a geometric nearest-node adoption
   read a phantom 4.2 % pair at CYXY).
3. **LAW** (``grade_law.crown_pair_offset`` + the field): every
   within-shape pair re-centres its budget on the crown target —
   ``|Δz − (c_b − c_a)| ≤ Allowance.at(...)`` — evaluated by
   check_grade (sidecar ``crown_drops`` → per-nid map, offset on
   ShapePairConstraint) and grade_graph_validate.within_violations /
   route_band_violations (de-crowned band compare).  Since every crown
   rate ≤ every transverse cap, the re-centred band still contains the
   FLAT surface — the offset can only restore budget, never flag an
   uncrowned patch.  The solver realises the same offsets via the z'
   transform, so the two readers share ONE field and cannot drift.
4. **RUNWAYS HAVE A SPINE**: ``crown.emit_crown_spines`` (called at the
   end of the solve) repopulates ``layout.crown_spines`` from the
   SOLVED route profiles (on-line graph-node elevations interpolated by
   arc, every ~12 m, ≥1 m inside the crowned pavement, ≥0.9 m off any
   ring) and from the persisted (post-flex) runway profiles clipped per
   piece.  to_osm's OPEN-way ``o4_feature=crown_spine`` emission and
   the check_grade skip are unchanged (KEEP list).
5. Fixed in passing: check_grade's sidecar point→nid grid matching used
   a per-point cos(lat) cell size — at lon −135 the integer cell index
   shifted by whole cells and silently missed matches (seam-pin class
   was too sparse to notice; the crown field exposed it).

## VERIFIED (gates)
* O4_SPINE_CROWN=0: SPLP and CYXY patches BYTE-IDENTICAL to HEAD
  gate-off builds.
* Crown ON (tools/full_airport_build.py → check_grade, law-true):
  - SPLP: within 16 == baseline 16 (identical pairs, values uniformly
    lower by the drop); cross/steps/plane 0; runway 02/20 crowned
    ~0.23 m (seam pieces taper to the pins).
  - CYXY: within 1 == baseline 1 (the known apron-#29 1.25 %); v1
    shipped 2.  cross/steps/plane 0.  Probe: ridge-above-edge
    14R/32L ≈ 0.21–0.24 m (1 % × 23 m), 14L/32R ≈ 0.14, 02/20 ≈ 0.09;
    32 crown_spine ways.
  - HECA: within 0 == baseline 0 (v1 shipped 2 marginal); plane/cross
    0; vertex-to-edge 3 + mid-edge 14 steps IDENTICAL to gate-off
    baseline (pre-existing service-road pair -10611/-10065); break
    pairs 5895 vs 5824 baseline (quarantined-by-design class).
  - fast_suite: EXACTLY the 8 pre-existing failures, zero new;
    test_cyxy_spine_zero + test_cyxy_spine_zero_no_bowl PASS.
  - full suite: the 13 pre-existing failures exactly (see commit).

## LANDED (part 30b) — clearance coverage: Pass A3 airside ring-edge
## sweep (fixes USER RULING part-29 #5, HECA terrain spikes)
ROOT CAUSE (recorded part 29): ``clearance.emit_surface_clearance_cuts``
built cuts only off 4-corner rects carrying ``altitude``/hi-lo (Pass B)
and off the taxi CENTERLINE trace (Pass A) — since part 25 every sloped
shape (and, since the unified runway representation, 51 of HECA's 56
runway pieces) emits per-node ``node_altitudes`` polygons, so junction /
apron / service-road edges away from a centerline were INVISIBLE to the
clearance builder.  FIX (clearance.py):
1. **Pass A3 ring-edge sweep**: walk every TERRAIN-FACING exterior-ring
   edge of airside pavement + service roads (station step, flat-shadow
   ceiling, cut-only, daylight, merge/emit — all REUSED from the
   existing strip builder).  Terrain-facing = the point 2 m outward
   (``_RING_PROBE_M``) is not covered by ANY already-emitted shape (the
   unbuffered static union — adjacent pavement / ribbon / building /
   groundside own their band).  Outward normal from RING ORIENTATION
   (the centroid flip is wrong on concave rings).  Per-role bands:
   taxi-family/junction/apron = full wingtip half-width of the nearest
   aircraft-taxi centerline's letter (Pass A2 pocket rule); runway
   family (non-rect pieces only; Pass B/RESA/skirts untouched) =
   Annex-14 strip reach from the row-100 centreline minus the station's
   centreline distance, END edges skipped (``_RING_END_NORMAL_DOT`` —
   RESA/skirt territory); service roads = NEW 15 m roadside band
   (``CLEARANCE_MAX_REACH_M["service"]`` +
   ``CLEARANCE_OBSTRUCTION_THRESHOLD_M["service"]``, STANDARDS.md row).
2. **Shared-mechanics fixes found by the audit**: ``_collect`` keeps
   the polygon PARTS when a self-intersecting strip ring buffers to a
   MultiPolygon (concave rings — a junction-notch spike survived the
   whole-run drop); ``_build_graded_strips`` run-taper borrows the
   run-end altitude so a SINGLE obstructed station between skipped ones
   still emits (apron/service corridors); ``_finalize``'s inner-edge
   snap list now includes service roads.
3. **Perf**: ``_make_strip_alt_resampler`` builds the strip edge/vertex
   STRtree ONCE per finalize (was: rebuilt per emitted piece, twice —
   finalize 38.9 s → 6.4 s once A3 multiplied the strip count).  HECA
   build 143.2 s (HEAD, warm) → 139.5–146.0 s with the fix (±2%);
   Pass A3 itself costs 0.6 s.
VERIFIED (gates):
* ``tools/clearance_spike_audit.py`` HECA: 1,372 samples / 461 clusters
  worst +15.70 m (HEAD baseline this session; the 1,306/443 in the
  part-29 note predates crown v2) → **203 / 119**.  Of the remaining
  203 samples, 179 sit ≤ 1.6 m from an emitted grading surface (the
  deliberate ``_PAVEMENT_GAP_M`` crack between pavement and cut inner
  edge — mesh-constrained on both sides); only 2 exceed +2 m beyond
  that: +7.97 m in ONE apron/service_junction corridor at
  30.116375,31.410066 (strip lost somewhere in finalize — open below)
  and +2.01 m at 1.6 m distance.  Worst baseline cluster
  (30.126175,31.418247, +15.7): now INSIDE cut way -10759, surface
  83.9 m ≤ apron edge 84.0 + 1.0 threshold.
* check_grade: HECA IDENTICAL to baseline (within 0, plane 0, cross 0,
  steps 3+14, break 5895); CYXY within 1 == baseline, rest 0; SPLP
  within 16 == baseline, rest 0.  Clearance roles carry no grade law
  (ROLE_GRADE_LIMITS → None) — unchanged.
* fast suite: EXACTLY the 8 pre-existing failures.  Full suite: the 13
  pre-existing exactly.  NOTE: the new cuts initially flipped
  ``test_cyxy_taxi_e_south_apron_follows_terrain`` to a FALSE pass (its
  bbox scan took a terrain-hugging clearance cut as "pavement
  climbing") — the test now excludes clearance roles from candidates
  and fails honestly again (the solver over-flattening it guards is
  untouched).
* Cut counts: HECA 105 → 114, CYXY 40, SPLP 10.

## OPEN (part 30 follow-ups)
* ONE residual audit spot at HECA (+7.97 m, 30.116375,31.410066): the
  apron/service_junction corridor stations are valid and obstructed
  (verified by replay) but the strip vanishes in the finalize
  union/clip chain — trace region → components → piece processing for
  that corridor if it matters in-sim.
* The 1.5 m pavement-gap crack band (179 audit samples) is bounded by
  constrained edges on both sides; if in-sim needles ever show there,
  the standoff convention (``_PAVEMENT_GAP_M`` + conformance) is the
  thing to revisit, not the sweep.
* Crossings emit no ridge (runway breaklines gap across the resolved
  crossing junction; its surface carries the min member drop) — a
  crossing-aware ridge weave is cosmetic follow-up.
* grade_feasibility_audit.py consumes ShapePairConstraint but ignores
  the new ``offset`` field (reads conservative-strict on crowned
  pavement); teach it |Δz − offset| if its counts start mattering.
* The in-sim eval should look at: corridor crown visibility, the
  runway ridge at thresholds, seam-taper creases at SPLP.

# STATUS — SESSION 20260707 (part 29): KCLT terminal-ramp groundside
# root cause — the airside/groundside EDGE CLASSIFIER was blind (pick up
# here)

## USER RULINGS + REPORTS (2026-07-07, in-sim eval — QUEUED part 30)
1. **SPJC perfect; CYXY great; KCLT classification fix verified by the
   part-29 rebuild** (see below).
2. **SPLP BROKEN → FIXED (part 29)**: "something broke the anchor at
   the seam where it crosses taxiways" — runway and apron OK.
   ROOT CAUSE (verified with per-tile probe builds): the THRESHOLD
   uniform-lift reconciliation (runway_segments) samples each CIFP
   threshold's surrounding DEM — for a cross-tile runway the far
   threshold is OUTSIDE the current tile's raster and ``dem.alt``
   silently CLAMPS to the edge column, so each tile build computed a
   different mean lift (−77 build: +1.9 m, using seam-column terrain
   for the west threshold 882 m into tile −78).  The divergent
   profiles (5.05 m worst) fed ``runway_clamp_floor`` → taxiway/
   junction seam pins 1.45 m apart across the 10 m gap = the in-sim
   scarp.  The pokes-above (+0.05 m) seam-anchor filter amplified it
   (one build kept the runway seam anchor, the other dropped it, so
   thresholds shifted on one side only).
   FIX: covering-raster rule in ``_sample_dem_ll`` — out-of-tile
   points sample the raster that covers them (``_load_airport_dem``,
   cached, graceful None fallback).  Profiles now bit-identical
   across tile builds; worst cross-tile seam delta 1.48 m → 0.09 m.
   Fast suite: same 8 pre-existing failures, zero new.
   ``O4_SEAM_DEBUG=1`` dumps per-build seam-anchor decisions in
   runway_redistribute (kept, env-gated).
   NOTE: the 2 ``test_compare_target_splp`` failures are a DIFFERENT
   (structural apron-matching, pre-existing) issue — not this.
3. **Lateral crown law (NEW, durable)**: everything with a SPINE —
   runways, taxiways, service roads — must crown for drainage: spine
   slightly higher than the edges, with PER-ROLE transverse-grade
   values researched from FAA AC 150/5300-13 / EASA CS-ADR-DSN and
   cited in docs/STANDARDS.md (constants in config.py).  Symptom being
   fixed: ridges/valleys along service-road spines at several
   airports (lateral grading currently unconstrained there).
   USER RULING (2026-07-07, after 29b review): the crown should NOT be
   a special post-solve module — it belongs in the GRADING itself:
   spine-vs-edge allowances.  AGREED DIRECTION for part 30 (the 29b
   module is a working v1; its freeze/veto/valve machinery exists only
   because it fights the solve after the fact):
   1. Level-coupling: the solver already couples lateral corridor
      nodes to their spine (the "8,548 lateral corridor node(s)" pass
      + solver_primitives' level-coupling graph) at OFFSET 0 — couple
      at −rate·lateral instead.  Welds then solve consistently by
      construction (no freeze sets, no consensus tears).
   2. Law: add an OFFSET field to grade_law.Allowance so spine↔edge
      pairs budget |Δz − crown_offset| ≤ cap·d; solver and validator
      read the same object → the validator CHECKS the crown;
      infeasible pockets go through break-region, replacing the
      revoke valve.
   3. Emission: spine breaklines from the SOLVED route profiles
      (routes already carry elevations — the axes sidecar) instead of
      ring interpolation; crown.py shrinks to that emission step.
   4. Runways: profile stays spine authority, edges derive inside the
      solve → the runway_join/flex/skirt readers see law-consistent
      values (the 29b runway exclusion should lift naturally).
   IMPLEMENTED (part 29b, superseded-in-place by the above plan):
   - ``crown.py`` ``apply_spine_crown`` (pipeline, after the final
     projection, before skirts; gate ``O4_SPINE_CROWN`` default ON):
     taxi-family corridors/rects (1 %) + service roads (1.5 %) drop
     their edges below the spine; spine breaklines emit as OPEN ways
     with per-node alt_abs (+ ``o4_feature=crown_spine``; check_grade
     skips them).  Axis fallback = longest apt.dat centerline through
     the shape (clip passes strip source_axis).  SAFETY MODEL: freeze
     everything not crowned (other roles, axis-less family shapes,
     MultiPolygon/holed shapes, seam vertices), register ZERO drops so
     near-axis owners veto neighbours' drops at shared vertices,
     budget-aware all-pairs Lipschitz smoothing at min(cL,cT)·d (a
     provable lower bound on any law allowance), and a revoke-valve
     that un-crowns any shape whose final values would still violate.
   - Law: ``_bake_edge`` cT — service-road-rate pairs now cap at
     SERVICE_ROAD_MAX_TRANSVERSE (2 %) instead of tilting at their 5 %
     longitudinal cap.
   - VERIFIED: SPLP within 16 == baseline; CYXY 2 (known apron-#29 +
     one at +0.16 %); HECA 2 (both ≤ +0.08 % over 60-95 m chords),
     break 5822→5811; fast suite = the 8 pre-existing failures
     exactly.  RUNWAYS EXCLUDED this slice: crowned runway corners
     broke the runway_join spine check (23 % step at CYXY) — the
     profile readers (join anchors, flex audit, skirts, seam pins)
     must learn the crown offset first; profile-axis wiring in
     crown.py is ready.  Also queued: SPLP corridors stage 0
     breaklines (narrow shapes + the 0.9 m ring-clearance filter).
   DESIGN GROUNDWORK (part 29, retained for the runway leg):
   - **Mesh unlock**: ``include_patches`` (O4_Vector_Map ~line 1115)
     inserts OPEN (non-closed) patch ways as constrained DUMMY
     breakline edges honouring per-node ``alt_abs`` — so a TRUE crown
     ridge needs NO polygon splitting: emit each spine as an open way
     at ``surface_at(station) + crown_rate × local_half_width``,
     tapered to 0 over the last ~half-width before shape ends (mouth
     continuity).  Runway sub-rects are planes → spine alt = plane at
     centerline + crown.
   - **Law side**: the anisotropic machinery already exists —
     ``grade_law.Allowance(cL, cT)`` + ``grade_graph._bake_edge``,
     which today sets cT = TAXI_MAX_TRANSVERSE_NARROW (2 %) only for
     A/B narrow taxi pairs and leaves everything else isotropic
     (service roads laterally capped at their 5 % LONGITUDINAL cap =
     25 cm across a 5 m road — the visible ridge/valley budget).
     Extend cT per role;  OPEN QUESTION to trace first: how
     service-road pairs actually flow through ``classify_pair`` /
     ``_edge_route`` (the ``both_road`` relax path vs spine_caps) so
     the transverse cap binds the RIGHT pairs on both readers.
   - Constants to add (pending the research table below):
     RUNWAY_{MIN,MAX}_TRANSVERSE, TAXI_{MIN,MAX}_TRANSVERSE (per
     letter; NARROW A/B 2 % exists), SERVICE_ROAD_{MIN,MAX}_TRANSVERSE
     + per-role CROWN rate; docs/STANDARDS.md rows with citations.
4. **Service-road adoption extension (durable)**: like the apron-edge
   rule, the PORTION of a service road inside or sharing a LONG edge
   with a taxiway follows the more limiting (taxiway) grade law; only
   isolated narrow-road stretches (nothing along the long edge) get
   the full 4 % road cap.
5. **Clearance coverage** — LANDED part 30b (see above): several spots
   at HECA show small terrain
   spikes right next to pavement — the clearance cuts miss them.
   ROOT CAUSE FOUND (part 29, fix queued): ``clearance.
   emit_surface_clearance_cuts`` builds cuts only off ``_usable``
   shapes = 4-CORNER rects carrying ``altitude`` or hi/lo — but since
   part 25 (hi/lo emission retired) every sloped shape emits per-node
   polygons, so junctions, aprons, and service roads are INVISIBLE to
   the clearance builder.  That matches the audit exactly (spikes
   cluster beside apron/junction/service edges).  FIX SHAPE: extend
   the pass to walk every airside ring edge with per-node altitudes
   (generalising the two-long-edge rect walk), cut-only as today.
   TOOLING: ``tools/clearance_spike_audit.py`` (committed) turns the
   report into worst-first coordinates — HECA baseline 1,306 samples /
   443 clusters, worst +15.7 m at 30.126175,31.418247; use it as the
   before/after gate for the fix.

## USER REPORT (part 29)
KCLT (in-sim/JOSM after part 28): complex mess of jagged shapes around
the central terminals + spurious groundside that should not exist.
HECA fine.  Root-caused to ``_terminal_groundside_zone`` (terminals.py)
misclassifying concourse-facing RAMP edges as groundside → 482,579 m²
subtracted (incl. the whole Concourse E ramp), which also SEVERED the
pavement graph → 96 shapes demoted by the runway-disconnected pass.
Three stacked blindnesses, each verified at KCLT:
1. **Nimbus KCLT apt.dat has ZERO row-110 pavement** (all pavement is
   DSF-draped) → ``apt_only_pav_polys`` empty → the airside-reachability
   BFS degenerated to "within 100 m of a runway" — never true at a
   terminal.  FIX (pipeline.py): fall back to the FULL pavement list
   (incl. DSF polys) when the apt-only snapshot is empty; airports with
   real row-110 keep the apt-only list bit-for-bit.
2. **OSM aprons at KCLT are multipolygon RELATIONS** (member ways carry
   no tags) → invisible to the ways-only aeroway catalog.  FIX
   (terminals.py): reconstruct matching relations' rings (closed
   members direct, open members polygonized — same pattern as
   ``_extract_osm_terminals``) into the airside catalog; new
   ``relations=`` param, single call site.
3. **Tag-set gap**: the real OSM tag is ``taxilane`` (the set only had
   ``taxi_lane``, which does not occur in OSM) and ``jet_bridge`` was
   missing — 159 + 124 such ways at KCLT concourses alone.  With all
   ramp edges UNKNOWN, the any-airside promotion turned them ALL
   groundside (100 m rectangles = the jagged sawtooth).

## VERIFIED (KCLT rebuild, gz-probe + coverage-probe instrumented)
- ground-zone subtraction 482,579 → 110,312 m² (genuine curbside only);
  all 7 probe points now airside end-to-end (1 stays groundside — a
  REAL pavement island 7 m off the apron, correct per the 2026-06-09
  island ruling).
- runway-disconnected demotions 96 → 9 (rest are road-served pockets).
- terminal zone (700 m): groundside 14 shapes/72.6 k m² → 1/2.6 k m²;
  aprons 48 fragments (median 2.2 k m²) → 13 shapes (median 36.6 k m²).
- check_grade: within 5 → 6 (all on one apron, worst +1.57 % excess,
  apron -10074 — new terrain the restored ramp must now grade over),
  break-region pairs 614 → 365, steps 4 → 3, plane/cross still 0.
- fast_suite: identical 8 pre-existing failures on stashed HEAD and on
  the fix — zero new failures.  HECA rebuilt: see scoreboard below.

# STATUS — SESSION 20260706 (part 28): KCLT keep-all-pieces + apron-edge
# service adoption + FLEX minimum-displacement

## USER RULINGS (part 28)
1. **Apron-edge service grading (PORTION-based, clarified)**: the portion
   of a service road/junction inside or alongside an apron follows APRON
   grading; the portion beyond the mouth grades at service rules.
   Implemented: apron-edge adoption pass (pipeline; split at the apron
   band = SERVICE_ROAD_WIDTH_M + 2 m), ``BuiltShape.adopts_apron_grade``
   → solver caps (_shape_grade / _body_cap / rect plane path) →
   ``o4_grade_law='apron'`` tag → check_grade override + OSM GradeShape.
2. **Flex = minimum displacement, taxi at max cap first** (user
   directive after in-sim: runways bending/dipping too much).

## FLEX FIX (root-caused end to end; tools/flex_audit.py verifies)
Chain of defects fixed in ``_apply_runway_flex_hook``:
- Sequential rounds let the FIRST runway absorb the whole inter-runway
  deficit (HECA 05C measured **17.8 m** one-sided) → rounds are now
  SNAPSHOT-SIMULTANEOUS.
- Demands now carry envelope ORIGIN (which runway pulls); a demand whose
  binding seed is another flexible runway moves **deficit/2** so the
  profiles meet in the middle (user's deficit÷runways formula);
  immovable origins (seam/CIFP) keep the full move.
- **RUNWAY_FLEX_MAX_DISPLACEMENT_M = 4.0** (config): cumulative budget
  per profile vs the pre-flex original.
- Shared-vertex propagation: flexed runway values re-stamp coincident
  vertices on neighbouring shapes + the solver seed (stale junction
  values were re-imposed through the shared bucket at writeback).
- The runway-join anchor loop no longer overrides flexed runway hard
  nodes (comment said "never override", code did).
- ``_sample_runway_segment_elev``: least-squares PLANE FIT replaced by
  axis-projected interpolation (diameter axis, NOT the bbox diagonal —
  that broke SE-heading runways, SPJC 16L 0.4 m anchor errors); the
  plane fit extrapolated ~3 m wrong on flexed (curved) pieces.
- GOTCHA that cost two diagnosis rounds: the pipeline wraps the hook in
  a blanket ``except`` → an IndexError (interpolating ORIGINAL elevs
  against the sample-mutated fractions) left builds HALF-FLEXED with
  only a one-line WARN.  Grep ``flex pass failed`` before trusting any
  flex measurement.
- VERIFIED (HECA flex-on): 0 within/0 plane/0 cross; ±4.00 m max
  displacement, bidirectional; audit shows zero taxi-not-at-cap
  clusters; 110 of 441 m demand drained, rest quarantined on the taxi
  side per FLEX-LAST.  SPJC 0 within (1 break), CYXY 1 within (the
  known #29 open).

## KCLT (user in-sim report) — fixed
- ``_drop_overlap_against_fixed_shapes`` kept only the LARGEST clip
  piece → the far side of every runway crossing was deleted (one-sided
  spines, ~6.6 k m² true loss).  All pieces ≥5 m² now survive as their
  own shapes and re-enter the fixed-point clip loop.
- The 50 m cut's near-zone counted GATE LEAD-IN taxilanes → 63 stand
  aprons re-roled whole → apron-island merges lost their hosts → the
  terminal ramp demoted to DEM groundside.  Zone now uses THROUGH
  routes only (each end joins another centerline or the runway).
- Cut pieces exempt from ``_drop_off_source_residue``
  (``from_route_proximity_cut`` flag).
- All 7 user coordinates verified restored (2 were already missing in
  the PRE-part-27 baseline and are now recovered); pt3 disc coverage
  0.27 → 0.73 (small residual notch remains).

## TOOLING RULING: persistent tools live in tools/ (NOT /tmp — it purged
## twice mid-session).  tools/full_airport_build.py, tools/flex_audit.py.

# STATUS — SESSION 20260706 (part 27): classification rulings landed;
# weld-authority machinery built; 3 open residuals

## USER RULINGS THIS SESSION (durable law)
1. **No apron may ever touch a runway** — memory
   apron_never_touches_runway_ruling.md.
2. **50 m route-proximity law**: pavement within 50 m of a taxi
   centerline or runway is NOT apron; beyond 50 m may be.  Enforced by
   the APRON ROUTE-PROXIMITY CUT (pipeline.py, config
   APRON_ROUTE_PROXIMITY_M): every ROLE_APRON shape is SPLIT at the
   50 m contour (taxi non-service centerlines ∪ runway union, mitre
   buffers) — near band → ROLE_JUNCTION, far part stays apron.  The
   original report (30.1142593,31.4157106): slice-corridor cells were
   flipping to apron via _reclassify_apron_junctions' whole-shape 55 m
   rule + neck-split pieces inheriting apron unconditionally.

## LANDED (all default-on; measure before trusting numbers elsewhere)
- **reclassified_from_junction flag** (layout.py/junction_repair) +
  neck-split piece re-eval (pipeline) — corridor cells return to
  junction.  HECA break-region 11,243 → ~1,334 (gate-off, −88 %).
- **Apron route-proximity cut** (pipeline, after neck-split).
- **Lot↔lot weld reconciliation** at reach time (anchors.py,
  O4_GS_MOUTH_RECONCILE): smaller lot adopts larger's ±cap·d band,
  ABSOLUTE Lipschitz cone (relative cones under-raise at-cap rings —
  measured 4.00 %→4.64 %).
- **Mouth VERIFY-AND-RELAX** post-yield (solve.py,
  O4_MOUTH_VERIFY_RELAX): pad/apron-conflicted mouth welds join the
  joint solve (pads move AFTER the reach-time welds — reconciling
  earlier chases stale values, measured +0.8 m WORSE); lots adopt the
  solved profile (adopt_projected_mouths, NO chord-limit — the
  downward limiter dragged an adopted mouth 2.1 m).  Freed mouths +
  still-contradictory weld↔weld edges → break export.  HECA #541/#546
  FIXED, #522 quarantined.
- **Service-road proximity coupling** (anchors dem_follow,
  O4_SVC_PROXIMITY_COUPLE, 2 m) + **parallel-edge conformance**
  (groundside.conform_parallel_service_edges, O4_SVC_PARALLEL_CONFORM)
  + DEM-follow break-blend export (layout._service_break_idx).
- **Triangle-plane law** (solve._project_triangle_planes,
  O4_TRIANGLE_PLANE_LAW): 3-vertex shapes' plane gradient clamped via
  the freest vertex within its law-edge interval; unfixable → break
  export; validator plane check + STEP checks now consume the break
  quarantine (check_grade).  HECA plane 2 → 0.
- **Terrain-pinned pair export** (final projection): violated edges
  touching seam/feature-weld pins (incl. 0.5 m-tolerant weld-key grid +
  torn-weld set) → quarantine.  Post-projection groundside re-limit +
  ribbon/bridge re-adoption + moved-weld quarantine (pipeline).

## SCOREBOARD at session end (gate-off, per-airport lab builds)
- SPJC 0 within + 0 break + 0 steps ✓
- HECA 0 within + 0 plane + 0 cross; ~1,334 break; **3+14 steps OPEN**
  (#578↔#64: two parallel service roads 1 m apart, 0.9 m wall — the
  DEM-follow blend did NOT fire there; O4_SVC_DEBUG_LL=30.102180,31.395020
  instrumentation is in anchors.py, /tmp/heca_final1.log has the dump).
- CYXY **1 within OPEN** (apron #29 pair 1.25 %, 0.25 % excess,
  693.56↔692.85 over 57 m at 60.714896,-135.064193 / 60.715385,-135.064502).
  DIAGNOSED DEEP: the 692.85 vertex is a boundary-bridge contact
  inserted POST-SOLVE (absent from the solve node list — nearest solve
  node 30 m away); at final-projection END the pair was LAWFUL
  (693.56/693.00 = 0.98 %) — something between writeback and emit
  restores 692.85 (bridge value).  The node has only 6 joint edges (a
  41-vert apron ring should give ~40) — the projection's lazy tier
  under-covers the shape in BOTH scoped and full paths
  (O4_SCOPED_FINAL_PROJECTION=0 A/B identical).  Feature-weld agreement
  gate never sees the bridge vertex (absent from feat_alt_by_key even
  with the 0.5 m grid).  NEXT: find who writes 692.85 after writeback
  (suspect emit consensus merging with the bridge ring vertex that the
  post-projection cascade also cannot see), and why the apron's
  constraint entry is ring-adjacent-only.
- **SUITE 12F/409P** (base10 was 10F/407P) — composition:
  * FIXED vs base10: test_cyxy_spine_zero, test_cyxy_route_reach_zero,
    test_cyxy_spine_zero_no_bowl (all three CYXY spine gates GREEN).
  * NEW: compare_target ×3 (SPJC + SPLP both tiles — the cut/
    classification changed geometry; recut fixtures with
    tools/build_target_osm.py ONCE the opens settle),
    test_pavement_grade[CYXY] (open residual above),
    test_pavement_grade[SPJC] (open 0.61 m pad step above).
  * Still failing from base10: HECA/SPLP grade + longitudinal (SPLP =
    flex Stage C), SPJC route-band/self-overlap, CYXY terrain-follow,
    solver_validator_same_edge_budgets.
  base10.txt kept for reference; do NOT recut until the 3 opens close.

## TOOLING (user 2026-07-06: persistent tools live in tools/, NOT /tmp)
- tools/full_airport_build.py — the lab build runner (replaces
  /tmp/spjc_lab/full_build.py; regenerate-in-/tmp notes are obsolete).
- tools/flex_audit.py — flex-on vs flex-off displacement map + binding
  taxi-axis slack per flexed cluster (FLEX-LAST verification).

## GOTCHAS ADDED
- Debug envs: O4_SLIVER_DEBUG (cut), O4_SVC_DEBUG_LL=lat,lon
  (dem_follow reach state), O4_PROJ_DEBUG_LL=lat,lon;lat,lon (final
  projection node state), O4_STEP_DEBUG prints [mouth-relax] /
  [terrain-scan] / [triangle-plane].
- _aeroway_centerlines_union carries runway axes ONLY for 4-corner
  runway rects — HECA's multi-segment runways contribute none (the
  cut uses runway_union directly for this reason).
- check_grade: plane + STEP sections now quarantine via break_nodes
  (same _touches_break_node as pairs; steps use vert_pt/proj_pt at
  2 m tolerance).

# STATUS — SESSION 20260706 (part 26): HANDOVER — HECA-to-zero plan
# (superseded by part 27 above)

## State at HEAD (all gates green, suite 10F == /tmp/base10.txt)

Actionable scoreboard (gate-off defaults): **CYXY 0 · SPJC 0 · SPLP 0
per-tile · HECA 2 within + 2 plane**.  With `O4_RUNWAY_FLEX=1` at
HECA: 11 actionable + 2,762 break-region (was 11,265 frozen).  KDFW 41
(not re-measured since the runway rework — remeasure before trusting).
ONE altitude representation end to end: per-vertex from creation,
per-node in the OSM (hi/lo + cell_size retired, `3383040`); base
Ortho4XP src untouched.

## AWAITING USER: in-sim visual of flexed HECA
FLEX IS NOW DEFAULT ON (part 27) — just restart Ortho4XP + rebuild
the tile.  Spots:
05L↔05C corridor aprons (30.131691,31.410624; 30.126324,31.413003 —
former 2 % quarantine blends), 05C midfield dip (~30.1073,31.4077).
Verdict gates Stage C + default-on.

## HECA-TO-ZERO PLAN (test_pavement_grade[HECA] measures GATE-OFF)

The 4 gate-off pairs, fully diagnosed this session:
1. **service_road #541 weld-authority conflict ×2** (18 %/2.78 m,
   98.87↔99.38): building22 pad weld vs groundside mouth weld, both
   values-AGREED (hard by the weld gate) but mutually conflicting — a
   0.51 m ramp needs 10 m at 5 %, the sliver has 2.78.  FIRST PROBE:
   why didn't `apply_service_road_dem_follow`'s break blend fire (both
   ends are its anchors; floor>ceil should blend + export)?  Fix
   ranked: (a) mouth reconciliation — ONE authority per mouth (the P4
   flush-weld machinery should make the lot adopt the pad-adjacent
   level); (b) road-graph break blend + export (honest quarantine);
   (c) re-role/merge the sliver.
2. **2 plane-gradient pairs** (apron 2.4 % @78.55 by building7;
   junction 6.8 % @115.81 at runway 05C corners): triangle-surface
   check — read `_check_plane_gradient` semantics first; likely shared-
   corner consensus/co-location at the same weld neighborhoods.
Then: green test → recut /tmp/base10.txt → base9.

## FLEX ARC (after in-sim sign-off)
- **Stage C**: intermediate anchors JOIN the solve — the fold-in
  currently freezes crossing/shape-vert anchors at old values;
  release them iteratively within the runway law.  Covers the SPLP
  displaced-02-threshold (fixes test_runway_longitudinal[SPLP]) and
  should eat into HECA's 2,762.
- Provenance tool for remaining pockets (which anchors bind).
- Default-on gates: KDFW/CYUL/SPLP counts + suite; flip
  O4_RUNWAY_FLEX default; then reconcile the flex-on HECA 11.
- Machinery map: docs/runway_flex_plan.md; hook =
  solve.py::_apply_runway_flex_hook; profile ops =
  runway_redistribute.apply_runway_flex / flex_slack_at (greedy-keep +
  verify-and-relax are load-bearing — see commit cddd950/558e000).

## TEST-ZERO CAMPAIGN REMAINDER (tasks #9-13, exact assertions in
## the 2026-07-06 inventory)
- CYXY spine-47 (5.9 % vs 5 % junction spines) — clears 2 tests.
- CYXY budget lockstep (6/6919 edges, all at one vertex, ~2 % drift).
- CYXY route-reach 4 + terrain-following (SW region 708.4 vs 714 —
  the OPEN spine-rise-to-region item).
- SPJC self-overlap (2 pairs, 9.6 m²) + route-band 3.
- SPLP seam-cut conformance hairline (parallel chains 0.8 m apart,
  9 cm) + the longitudinal red (→ Stage C).

## GOTCHAS FOR THE NEW SESSION
- /tmp gets purged: recreate /tmp/spjc_lab/full_build.py (template in
  this session's transcript) + /tmp/base10.txt (regenerate: full suite
  → FAILED lines sorted).  SPLP is measured PER-TILE.
- Probe frames: check_grade._ll_to_m_factory without anchor= is the
  MEAN frame; layout probes convert lat/lon via layout.ll_to_m.
- solver_primitives.SLOPING_RECT_ROLES ≠ junction_rules' same-named
  tuple (solver's includes service_road).
- ORDERING LAW (×3 now): every value-moving or geometry pass runs
  BEFORE final_grade_projection; anything after must be law-guarded.

# STATUS — ROUND-4 QUEUE (user-approved 2026-07-03): SPJC 178 → 0

> 1. **Solver-graph coverage gap** (whole ≥1% tail, ~54): 13 long

>    — building-key detection mismatch on the solver side (V15 apron_keys
>    family, likely grade_graph.build_context).  Diagnose OFFLINE (proj_lab
>    gapcheck pair → step through classify_pair).  Fix identity, not geometry.
> 2. **Item B — off-source post-slice merges**: probe CYXY apron #120 centroid
>    (60.71179,-135.07152) through the coverage probes (one build), fix the
>    guilty pass (clip to source_pavement_union / veto), then flip
>    `O4_SPINE_STEP_STRAIGHT_M=24` ON (banked: −23 law-true, −9.5 s, SPLP
>    rests_on_source clears).
> 3. **Hairline floor (~124 <0.5%)**: (a) 51 endpoints inserted POST-solve
>    (T-weld adoptions etc.) → final micro-projection on the emitted node set
>    before to_osm; (b) 2-decimal rounding eats sub-metre budgets — test
>    3-decimals offline in proj_lab first.
> 4. **Lock + propagate**: recut SPJC compare-target; re-measure CYXY (expect
>    big free drop from movable pads); HECA by playbook (rate → audit →
>    gapcheck) LAST so only HECA-shaped classes remain.

# STATUS — SPJC drive-to-zero, round 2 (2026-07-03) — HEAD `9399d9c`

> Suite **16F/329P/17S** (−1 vs baseline).  Dev checks: `O4_LOG_VERBOSITY=1`.
>
> ## Round-2 fixes (user: holes + skeleton fidelity)
> 1. **HOLE KEYHOLES** (`global_slice`): TWO spur cuts per interior ring
>    (nearest spine, else boundary; second from the antipodal ring point) —
>    ONE cut makes a SLIT polygon whose doubled edge collapses under vertex
>    dedup and paves the hole over.  SPJC: 19 of 36 holes paved-over → **1**
>    (28 open ✓, 7 under building pads ✓).
> 2. **SIMPLE-SHAPES INVARIANT** (pipeline, pre-solve): airside shapes with
>    interior rings (merge passes can rebuild an annulus) are decomposed via
>    the rect-era `_decompose_polygon_with_holes` (its old home junction_emit
>    is bypassed under the slice).
> 3. **`_resample` → `shapely.segmentize`**: even respacing MOVED original
>    spine vertices (bends/arcs); densify now preserves every input vertex.
> 4. **DIAGNOSED, next round**: the user's missing spine node
>    (-12.0334639,-77.1065028) IS a face vertex at raw slice output (0.01 m)
>    and is destroyed downstream — the rect-era SLIVER-JUNCTION MERGE unions
>    adjacent faces and dissolves spine-carrying shared edges.  Fix: exempt
>    merges across spine edges, or retire the sliver merge under the slice
>    (conformant faces don't produce the decomposition slivers it targets).
> 5. SPJC law-true 539 → 1165 = the SAME classes (per-pad seat conflicts >3 %
>    + projection hairline) over newly-SURVIVING stand pavement — all funnels
>    into the seat-coupling work (round-1 item a).
>
> ## SPJC queue (updated)
> a. Building seat coupling (biggest, unchanged).
> b. Sliver-merge vs spine edges (item 4 above — restores skeleton fidelity).
> c. Source-level pavement hole probe (-12.03309,-77.10638).
> d. Projection hairline once (a) lands.

# STATUS — SPJC drive-to-zero, round 1 (2026-07-03) — HEAD `783d349`

> Suite 17F/329P/16S (stable baseline).  `O4_ROUTE_ARC_SPINE` default ON.
> **Reminder: dev grade checks need `O4_LOG_VERBOSITY=1`** (sidecar gate).
>
> ## Findings + fixes (user JOSM round 2, SPJC)
> 1. **Building↔spine 1 % now ENFORCED** — the reported 3.5 % chord
>    (building-10031 ↔ spine, 86 m) was *legalised* by two relaxations: the
>    4 % road-frontage carve (service road hugs the terminal) and the
>    apron↔taxi blend (which since v14.1 also blends against 4 % service
>    spines).  Both now exclude building-endpoint pairs (`grade_law`), and
>    service spines never blend aprons (`grade_graph`).  The pair solves to
>    exactly **1.00 %**.
> 2. **SPJC law-true 174 → 961 — the law got honest, the surface didn't get
>    worse.**  Audit: 0 fundamental / 961 unenforced, POCS→0 in 77 sweeps.
>    The >3 % class (~380) = pre-existing PER-PAD SEAT CONFLICTS
>    (neighbouring pads seated up to 2.6 m apart — building26 class) that the
>    blend had waived; the 1.06 %-ramp class = projection residual around
>    raised aprons.  **NEXT BIG ITEM: seat COUPLING in building_feasibility —
>    choose jointly-feasible pad levels (audit proves they exist), then the
>    yield projection converges.**
> 3. **Slice coverage is SOUND** — faces ≡ slice input exactly (verified
>    standalone AND in-pipeline via new `debug_pts` tracing).  The
>    user-visible holes are SOURCE-level: `pav_union` never had that
>    pavement.  One cause fixed: the DSF overlay gate dropped WHOLE polygons
>    ≥80 % inside apt.dat — their outside strips (real pavement) are now
>    kept (≥50 m², SPJC +5 polys).  At least one reported hole remains
>    unexplained at source level (probe -12.03309,-77.10638; rect model
>    identical) — trace which apt.dat/DSF/OSM input should cover it.
> 4. **"Dropped through-line" at -12.0332845,-77.106591 is NOT a bug** — the
>    apt.dat route network genuinely ends at that stand (tool + production
>    agree); v13 route-verbatim = no route, no spine.  The area LOOKS broken
>    because of the source-level pavement hole next to it (see 3).
> 5. **Apron-scope architecture ANSWERED (user question)**: no geometry
>    refinement needed — grading scope comes from BUILDING PROXIMITY via the
>    law: building-endpoint pairs are 1 % (never blended/relaxed), the rest
>    of a mixed face grades at taxi law with spine credit.  shapeID-70-style
>    mixed faces are fine under this model once seats are coupled.
> 6. Debug infra: `O4_COVERAGE_PROBE="lat,lon;…"` prints probe owners after
>    each post-slice pass; `build_global_slice_faces(debug_pts=…)`;
>    `O4_SLICE_SOURCE_CLIP=0`.
>
> ## Perf (user report: build time ~doubled) — FIXED at `7c6d33c`
> Measured SPJC: rect 51.6 s vs global slice **160 s** (solve 25.7→140 s,
> 5.4×).  Root: ~500 UNCHAINED route pieces made the solver's nearest-line
> scans quadratic (25 M `_project` calls / ~90 s).  Fixes: STRtree caches on
> GradeContext for nearest-route/centerline/spine-membership; vectorised
> Jacobi `feasibility_project` under the slice (was gated off).  Now
> **92 s** total (solve 75 s) — and the better projector also dropped SPJC
> law-true 961 → **681**.  Suite runtime 8 min → 4.5 min.  Remaining solve
> budget if needed: shape_constraints is built twice per shape
> (build_unified_graph + _build_shape_constraints), node_bands ~36 s.
>
> ## SPJC to zero — remaining queue
> a. Building seat coupling (the 961 → small; biggest lever).
> b. Source-level pavement holes (item 3 probe).
> c. Hairline projection residual (~1.06 % ramps) — tighten the yield
>    projection once seats stop conflicting.
> d. Then the localized 0.2-0.45 m solver dips (STATUS v15 item C).

## v14.1 fixes (this session, after the default flip)

1. **SPLP seam cliff (user-reported regression) — FIXED, 24 → 0.**
   `nudge_runway_corners_at_seam_junctions` assumed a seam piece is a SMALL
   terrain-pinned stub; a sliced face reaches the tile line from 480 m away, so
   it dragged runway 02/20's threshold 5.4 m off its FAA profile.  Skipped under
   the global slice (`pipeline.py` call site) — seam pins stay truth-hard and the
   solver spreads the drop (cap × 480 m ≫ 5.4 m).
2. **Service roads = road-cap spines (user ruling) — CYXY 300 → 174.**
   Service centerlines are sliced; NARROW faces riding only a truck route
   (width ≤ 25 m) emit `ROLE_SERVICE_JUNCTION` (restores `road_zone`); wide
   pavement crossed by a truck route stays apron.  `grade_graph.build_context`
   adds service lines as SPINES at `SERVICE_ROAD_MAX_GRADE` under the slice
   (longitudinal 4 % solve along the road); `taxi_axes_ll` exports service axes
   at the road cap (was accidentally 1.5 %).
3. **Rect-era test triage**: `test_junction_invariants` + `test_junction_rules`
   skip under `ROUTE_ARC_SPINE` (rect-residue semantics, kept for legacy path).

## What happened this session

1. **Audit of the 1242→2533 doubling** (the old rect-path A/B): NOT worse grading —
   the violation *rate* went DOWN (5.64%→5.11%); the count doubled because the arcs +
   their corner legs were both sliced per-junction → 2.25× constrained pairs
   (sliver faces, dense cut nodes). The metric itself was also off: the CLI
   `check_grade` ran context-free (no axes/routes → no spine/blend/aniso credit).
2. **USER RULING mid-session: with the full spine, disable taxi-RECT creation — the
   spine runs everywhere.** Implemented: `O4_ROUTE_ARC_SPINE=1` now implies the
   curve-native **global slice** (`apply_route_arc_spine` runs at the slice stage;
   pav_union cut once by route+arc ways; rect emit / junction_emit / fillet /
   synthetic-spine / junction_spine all bypassed). `2f828e1`.
3. **Axes sidecar** (`10eb088`): `layout.to_osm` writes `<patch>.axes.json`;
   `tools/check_grade.py` auto-loads it → the standalone CLI now applies the SAME
   within-shape law as the solver/suite. Context-free numbers (1242 etc.) are
   obsolete; compare law-true only.
4. **Solver adaptations** (found via `tools/grade_feasibility_audit.py` — all
   violations were 0-fundamental/all-unenforced, POCS→0):
   * **No dedup for route-arc slice input** — the 3.5 m paint-dedup ate short
     junction connector fragments (481→399), disconnecting spine chains: PHASE A
     froze adjacent route chains up to 2.6 m apart (frozen-spine walls).
   * **`classify_faces` v2** — corridor by geometry (width = area/shared-edge), not
     centerline count; big multi-CL faces are JUNCTION when ≥55% of area is within
     25 m of their centerlines; only true stand/terminal pavement keeps 1 % apron law.
   * **SPINE-YIELD projection** (`route_profile/solve.py`, global-slice only, LAST
     before writeback): most nodes are spine under the slice, so "both-hard =
     genuine step" is wrong; re-project with only truth anchors hard (runway/CIFP,
     tile-seam pins, building seats, groundside pins).

## Scoreboard (law-true `tools/check_grade.py <patch>` with sidecar, within-shape)

| fixture | rect baseline (gate OFF) | v14.0 | **v14.1 (HEAD)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPJC | 198 | 185 | **175 ✓ below** |
| CYXY | 138 | 300 | **174** (1.26× — building seats remain) |
| SPLP | 0 | 24 | **0 ✓ = baseline** |
| HECA | 4138 | 5275 | 5184 ✗ (+4 cross-shape desyncs) |

Open items (named, diagnosed):

- **CYXY 174 vs 138**: building-frontage seat conflicts — pads seated at
  incompatible levels 1–2 m apart (production pins seats; the audit proves a
  compliant field exists if seats could move → the building-FEASIBILITY seat
  solver must pick frontage-compatible levels, or the spine-yield should treat
  each building as a movable FLAT group like the audit does). Worst spots:
  (88,-399), (117,-533) + building-10002, (-243,914).
- **HECA 5184 vs 4138**: not yet dissected (builds clean end-to-end; suspect the
  same building-seat class at scale + 4 cross-shape desyncs).
- **`test_pavement_rests_on_source` red ×3 (CYXY/SPJC/SPLP)** — GENUINE: the
  slice emits every face of the local `pav_union`, which contains area that is
  NOT apt.dat/DSF source (SPLP faces #19/#20: 82k/34k m² at 20-24 % on source —
  pavement over grass in the sim). The rect pipeline separated/dropped that
  area (groundside separation, residue rules). Fix direction: intersect the
  slice input with `source_pavement_union`, or run the groundside/clearance
  separation before the slice. **This is the top JOSM-visible defect.**
- `node_altitudes` are written at 0.1 m resolution — at sub-metre pair distances
  rounding alone can eat the budget; part of the <0.5 %-over tail is noise.

## Where things are

- Wiring: `pipeline.py` (`_global_slice_spine = CURVE_NATIVE_SPINE or
  ROUTE_ARC_SPINE`, slice branch ~line 3360; the old pre-slice hook is gone).
- Gate: `config.ROUTE_ARC_SPINE` (env `O4_ROUTE_ARC_SPINE`, default OFF).
- Solver: `route_profile/solve.py` — `truth_hard` captured pre-freeze; SPINE-YIELD
  block right before `_writeback`.
- Faces: `pavement/global_slice.py::classify_faces` (route-territory rule).
- Sidecar: `layout._write_axes_sidecar` + `tools/check_grade.py::main`.
- Iteration tools (session scratchpad patterns worth recreating): full-build script
  (`build_airport_pavement` → `to_osm` → CLI check); law-true probe = build →
  `verification.taxi_axes_ll/taxi_routes_ll` → `check_grade._check_within_shape`;
  `tools/grade_feasibility_audit.py <ICAO>` classifies fundamental vs unenforced
  (env gates apply — run with `O4_ROUTE_ARC_SPINE=1`).
- Debug: `O4_STEP_DEBUG=1` prints one_solve residuals by node type ("seam" there
  = any base_hard node incl. frozen spine, NOT just tile seams).

## NEXT SESSION

1. **`rests_on_source` fix** (top JOSM-visible defect): stop emitting faces over
   non-source pavement — intersect the slice input with
   `source_pavement_union` (+ runway), or run groundside/clearance separation
   before the slice. Then re-check the invariant ×4.
2. **CYXY building-seat frontage coupling** (174 → ≤138): frontage-compatible
   seat levels in `building_feasibility`, or movable-flat-group buildings in the
   spine-yield projection.
3. **HECA dissection** (rate + audit + forensics — the session-1 playbook) +
   its 4 cross-shape desyncs.
4. Recut SPLP/SPJC compare-target fixtures once v14 geometry settles; re-baseline
   `test_pavement_grade` counts.

Suggested kickoff:
> "Continue V14.1 (STATUS.md + memory pav_skeleton_medial_axis_spine.md):
> route-arc global slice default ON; SPJC 175<198 ✓, SPLP 0 ✓, CYXY 174 vs 138,
> HECA 5184 vs 4138. Fix rests_on_source (slice emits pav_union area that isn't
> apt.dat/DSF source — pavement over grass), then CYXY building seats, then HECA."
