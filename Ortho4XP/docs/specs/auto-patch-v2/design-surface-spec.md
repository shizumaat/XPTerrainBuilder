# v2 — THE DESIGN SURFACE: one smoothness solve (spec, 2026-09-08)

Owner (RULINGS 2026-09-08t, interview): pavement is a designed surface —
minimum curvature, unbounded cut and fill, flush and tangent at every
contact, the DEM a datum only, laws as targets, the sim as acceptance.
v1 graded/filled/cut to such a surface; v2's per-vertex DEM fit plus
hard laws is what undulates. Author: session (Fable). Implementer: lane
`v2smooth`. Replaces the objective and the hard-law solve; keeps the
planar map, classification, shapes (08p), joints (08k/08r), routes,
structures, the emit path, the instruments.

## 1. The model

Unknowns: z at every planar vertex (as today). ONE sparse least-squares
problem (`scipy.sparse` + `lsqr`/`cg`, or HiGHS QP — the lane measures
both on CYXY and HECA and states the wall):

    minimise  Σ_bodies  w_bend · ‖ L z ‖²                (thin-plate bending, per connected pavement complex — L the cotangent/umbrella Laplacian on the planar triangulation of pavement faces, so bending is minimised in every direction and tangency holds across every shared edge: bodies that touch are one sheet)
            + Σ_runways w_chord · ‖ z_ridge − chord ‖²   (the threshold chord, per ridge station)
            + Σ_laws    w_law   · ‖ max(0, violation) ‖² (every law row of today's generators — grade caps, transverse, K, rate, no_step, crown, portions — as a ONE-SIDED quadratic penalty: a design target, not a bound)
            + Σ_zones   w_dem   · ‖ z − DEM ‖²           (ONLY on adjacent-ground / graded-strip zone vertices, weighted from 0 at the pavement edge to 1 at the zone's outer ring — the blend inside today's zone widths; beyond the outer ring the vertex is not an unknown: it IS the DEM)
            + Σ_roads   w_road  · ‖ L_chain z ‖² + law penalties (roads as smooth chains at their own caps, welded at their pavement contacts, ramping between levels; the ground between = DEM)
    subject to  z_pin = CIFP threshold  (equalities; and the flat-site datum on a flat site, 05k)
                joints: no bending term and no row across a joint (08k/08r-2; split vertices as today)
                structures: floors, rims, ramps as today (pins/targets on their rings)

No DEM term on pavement vertices. No hard grade law. No tiers, IIS,
relaxation, yield groups, ceilings, preference rows: `solve/relax.py`,
`stage1.py`, `variance.py`, `lexi.py`, `constraints/yielding.py` and the
`[relaxation]`/`[yield]` tables are DELETED (refuted machinery is not
kept gated). `constraints/*` generators stay as the SOURCE of law rows
(now penalties) — one code path for the generator, the penalty and the
verify reader.

Weights are law-table values in `emit.toml [design]` (`bend`, `chord`,
`law`, `dem_zone`, `road`), chosen so that on the CYXY/OTHH twins the
laws are met where the geometry allows (the penalty is one-sided and
strong) and a runway on a valley sits on its chord.

## 2. Datum and contacts

* Runway ridge: chord + vertical curve (K) targets; transverse and crown
  targets across; the runway is the senior sheet only through its pins
  and its chord weight — no tier.
* Taxiways, aprons, pads, roads inside them: the same sheet as whatever
  they touch (flush + tangent come from the shared Laplacian). An
  isolated body (no route, no touching pavement) is chained to the
  nearest pavement it touches by a road; a truly detached body's datum
  is its own DEM mean (one soft term on the body's mean).
* Joints (08k/08p/08r): the only discontinuities.
* Structures: as today (floors/rims pinned, ramps as chains).

## 3. What is deleted, what stays (consumer census, owner 30l — the
lane's table before editing)

Deleted: the LP tiers/last resort/yield machinery listed above, the
`law_tiers` report block, `yielded_rows`, `apron_over_preference` (the
census reports law rows as v1's does — a target missed is a row,
stamped `design_target`). Stays: every generator, every verify reader
and the oracle (they read the built surface; the owner reads the sim),
reach bands (as targets), the route graph (for contacts and reach),
shapes/joints, terraces, structures, rebake/seats, emit, sidecar
(`terrace_joints`, `axes`, `stretches` unchanged; the `law_tiers` key
replaced by `design`: the residual per family).

## 4. Twins (`tests/auto_patch_v2/test_v2smooth.py`)

A runway over a V-valley DEM sits on its chord (fill, not the DEM); a
taxiway leaving it is tangent at the edge (no kink: the second
difference across the contact ≤ the along-chain one); an apron over a
ridge is a minimum-curvature sheet (bending energy below the DEM's);
the graded strip blends to the DEM inside its zone width and the outer
ring equals the DEM; a physical-gap joint stays a step; a road ramps
between two apron levels at its cap; a law penalty is met where
feasible (CYXY's within_shape reads 0) and reported where not; the
solve is one call, no relaxation path exists.

## 5. Acceptance (ONE airport = HECA, then CYXY/OTHH/LEMD `--base-arm`)

HECA `build_airport.py HECA --engine v2` once: `tools/rwy_profile.py
--binned --compare` vs v1 (`/tmp/harness/HECA_20260908T073420.osm`:
bows −4.25 / −9.53 / −0.28; z−DEM +4.70 / −2.63 / +1.99), `tools/
patch_proximity_diff.py` vs v1 by role (the SW strips: v1 +4–5 m fill;
pav132: v1's 7–10 m cut), the owner's site and the neck (no step, the
grade), an UNDULATION read: per body the RMS second difference of z
along every chain and the max grade change per 100 m (v1 vs 1.0.295 vs
this — the owner's complaint in a number), the census (rows stamped
`design_target`), solve wall (bar: ≤ the 1.0.293 47 s — one sparse
solve), CYXY/OTHH/LEMD verify and their undulation reads. The sim read
is the acceptance; the KML of the three runway profiles is not needed —
the table is. Build-time statement.
