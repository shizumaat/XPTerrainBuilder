# Install software dependencies from brew.  Unversioned 'python' floats
# to Homebrew's newest (3.13+) — recommended for ~5-10% faster builds;
# any Python >= 3.11 works (numpy 2.4 sets the floor), never required
# newer (user 2026-07-05: newer Python = a performance gain, not a
# requirement).
# proj + gdal also power the optional airport elevation insets
# (meter-class lidar over airports); if the python bindings are missing
# that feature logs one line and disables itself — builds still work.
