"""Automatic per-airport high-resolution elevation insets.

This module fetches meter-class public elevation (for example the United
States Geological Survey 3D Elevation Program, "3DEP") for the neighbourhood
of every airport on a tile, caches it under ``Elevation_data/``, overlays it
on the base elevation, and -- crucially -- bakes the overlaid values into the
raster that the Triangle4XP mesher actually reads.  See
``docs/airport_elevation_insets_spec.md`` for the full design.

The provider framework is DECLARATIVE, mirroring Ortho4XP's imagery
providers: a source is described by a ``Providers/Elevation/<CODE>.elv``
``key=value`` file (parsed by :func:`initialize_elevation_providers_dict`),
and the genuinely-logic part -- how bytes are fetched -- lives in a named
ACCESS STRATEGY registered in :data:`ACCESS_STRATEGIES`.  Phase A shipped one
definition (``USGS3DEP.elv``) and one strategy (``tnm_cog``); Phase C2 added
a second family (``HRDEM.elv`` + the ``stac`` strategy) as the extensibility
proof -- one class + one definition, no orchestration change.  Adding a
future provider is a new ``.elv`` file plus, only if its fetch differs, one
new strategy class + one registry entry -- with zero changes to the
discovery/cache/composite/bake orchestration below.

Phase C1 additionally densifies the working grid over inset tiles (the
``densify_tile_dem_for_insets`` / ``resolve_working_grid_factor`` section
below): the ``.alt`` raster the mesher reads is built on a finer grid so the
meter-class inset relief survives the Triangle4XP one-working-pixel
refinement floor, chosen per tile by a cheap numpy ideal-bake check on the
cached inset before any build.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
G2 flow finding -- how a composite source reaches the ``.alt`` raster
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mandatory first investigation (spec section 3.3, goal G2) traced how a
composite ``custom_dem`` (the ``base;sub1;sub2`` syntax in
``O4_DEM_Utils.py``) reaches the ``.alt`` file that Triangle4XP consumes.

What the composite mechanism actually does (``O4_DEM_Utils.py``):
  * ``DEM.load_data`` splits ``base;sub1;sub2`` into a BASE raster
    (``self.alt_dem``, an in-memory array) plus a tuple of strict
    ``self.subdems``.
  * The subdems are consulted ONLY at QUERY TIME by ``alt_composite`` /
    ``alt_vec_composite`` (i.e. ``dem.alt(node)`` / ``dem.alt_vec(way)``),
    which return the highest-priority sub-DEM value at a point, else the
    base.  Later tokens win (``subdems[::-1]`` in ``alt_composite``).
  * ``DEM.write_to_file`` writes ONLY ``self.alt_dem`` -- the base array.
    It never consults the subdems.

Who writes and who reads the ``.alt`` file:
  * Step 1 (``O4_Vector_Map.build_poly_file`` ->
    ``O4_Airport_Utils.smooth_raster_over_airports``) smooths
    ``tile.dem.alt_dem`` in place and calls ``write_to_file`` -> ``.alt``.
  * Step 2 (``O4_Mesh_Utils.build_mesh``) loads the DEM ``info_only=True``
    (so ``alt_dem`` is ``None``) and hands Triangle4XP the on-disk ``.alt``
    file directly; the mesh vertex elevations come from that raster.

CONCLUSION: sub-DEM / inset values do NOT reach the ``.alt`` raster through
the composite mechanism.  The composite only feeds the QUERY path
(``alt_vec`` -- used for OSM vector node elevations and, via
``auto_patch.elevation._load_airport_dem(override_dem=tile.dem)``, for the
grading seeds).  So this feature needs BOTH:

  1. Composite-source augmentation (``assemble_inset_composite_source``) so
     inset values reach the vector / grading QUERY path automatically.
  2. An explicit RASTER BAKE (``bake_airport_insets_into_alt_dem``) so inset
     values reach the ``.alt`` file the mesher reads.  The bake samples each
     cached inset into ``tile.dem.alt_dem`` over its footprint with a
     feathered blend band (``airport_elevation_inset_feather_m``, default
     60 m) so the inset->base seam is a ramp, not a cliff.  It runs in
     step 1 just before ``write_to_file``, so both steps see one raster,
     and again on step 2's ITERATIVE-refinement branch, which rewrites the
     ``.alt`` from the ``tile.iterate``-th user sub-DEM (that load keeps
     nodata, so the bake takes the inset outright over base nodata cells
     instead of blending against the sentinel).

The synthetic-inset unit test in ``tests/test_airport_elevation_insets.py``
proves the bake: a flat inset over a flat base appears at inset cells, ramps
across the feather, and leaves the base untouched outside.

    NOAA NCEI publishes several CUDEM regions (CONUS coasts, Guam) NOT as a
    STAC catalog but as a single ``urllist<id>.txt`` file: one Cloud-
    Optimized GeoTIFF URL per line, the tile's location encoded in the
    filename.  There is no per-tile JSON to walk (unlike ``static_stac``),
    so discovery fetches that ONE text file once, parses every filename's
    coordinate token into a bounding box, and memoises the result in a
    per-provider index under ``Elevation_data/`` -- the first airport in a
    region pays the single small download, every later airport and every
    rebuild reads the index.  Fetch is the shared windowed ``/vsicurl``
    warp core (only the requested window of each remote tile is read).

    Filename grammar and its coordinate semantics (validated 2026-07-16
    against the NCEI STAC oracles -- do NOT change without re-validating):

      * The token pair is ``_[ns]DDxQQ_[ew]DDDxQQ_`` where ``x`` (or its
        uppercase ``X`` variant, both live in the CONUS list) is the
        decimal separator and ``QQ`` is hundredths of a degree in
        {00,25,50,75}.
      * The LATITUDE token gives the tile's NORTH edge: ``n`` = positive
        latitude, ``s`` = negative.  Verified against Hawaii item
        ``ncei19_n22x00_w159x50`` (bbox north 22.0002) and, for the
        southern hemisphere, American Samoa items
        ``ncei19_s14x25_w169x75`` (bbox north -14.2498) and
        ``ncei19_s14x00_w169x50`` (bbox north -13.9998): ``s14x25`` is the
        NORTH edge at -14.25, not the south edge.
      * The LONGITUDE token gives the tile's WEST edge: ``w`` = negative
        longitude, ``e`` = positive (Guam ``ncei19_n13x25_e144x50`` ->
        west 144.50).
      * Every tile is 0.25 deg x 0.25 deg, so ``east = west + 0.25`` and
        ``south = north - 0.25``.

    Lines whose filename carries no such token (the list also holds
    shapefile sidecars, metadata ``.xml``/``.json``, ``.zip`` archives and
    the list file itself) are skipped, reported once as a summary count --
    never one warning per line.

    """Tiles-only ArcGIS elevation services (LERC blobs in Web Mercator).

    Some open city terrain models (Rio de Janeiro's lidar) are hosted
    as ArcGIS image services whose ``exportImage`` is disabled: the
    only data channel is a pre-rendered tile pyramid of single-band
    float LERC blobs on the STANDARD global Web Mercator grid, so a
    tile's (row, column) at a level are ordinary slippy-map
    coordinates.  Fetch computes the covering tiles at ``tile_level``,
    downloads the blobs, decodes them ALL in one subprocess (the
    imagecodecs LERC decoder and the osgeo libraries abort a shared
    process -- the same isolation the New Zealand provider uses),
    assembles an EPSG:3857 mosaic and warps it through the shared
    core.  Missing tiles (outside the service's data mask) are simply
    absent from the mosaic.

    The ground estimate is a grey (morphological) OPENING of the raster:

    Structures narrower than the window are levelled out of the estimate,
    so their pixels show a positive residual; a planar slope is invariant
    under opening, so genuine hillsides show none; terrain features with
    GRADUAL flanks survive into the estimate and are preserved regardless
    of width.  Contiguous cliff-edged plateau wider than the window
    (dense-city rooftop fabric) is recovered ITERATIVELY: each pass fills
    the masked cells from the nearest trusted ground and re-runs the
    opening, so the plateau's sharp edge recedes ~half a window per pass;
    ``erosion_passes`` bounds the total reach.  ``exclude_mask`` cells

    ESTIMATOR (2026-07-18, second iteration): the ground reference is a
    LOCAL MEDIAN, not a morphological opening — an opening is exactly
    invariant on a half-plane step (erosion shifts the cliff edge, the
    dilation shifts it back), so it can never start biting into wide
    city-plateau fabric.  The median over a symmetric window of a plane
    is its centre value (slopes and gradual flanks are invariant), while
    any pixel whose window is MAJORITY ground gets pulled down to
    ground, which both levels isolated structures and lets the fill
    iteration recede a plateau edge pass by pass.  Computed on a grid
    decimated to ~15 m cells: the interesting sources are 30 m-native
    DSMs oversampled to 3 m, so decimation loses nothing and keeps the

    against (stored per airport under ``"bounding_box"``).  A request equal
    to or inside what is cached never refetches.  Records written before

    each spends download wall time the build-time budgets exclude

# basins appear in the inset rasters as large flat plateaus sitting
# BELOW their rims — the KBNA wastewater ponds measure a 0.02 m
# internal range against rims 10+ m higher.  Such basins are usually
# absent from OpenStreetMap (no ``natural=water`` way exists over the
# KBNA ponds), so the mesh keeps raw noisy terrain there instead of the
# flat water the ``WATER`` seed + ``water_smoothing`` pipeline would
# produce.  These functions derive the missing polygons from the inset
# rasters themselves and write a per-tile OSM fragment which
# ``include_water`` merges ADDITIVELY into the water layer.

#   16,000 m2 plateau with 0.000 m internal range).  At the strict
#   thresholds exactly one basin qualifies at KBNA and every apron,
#   pavement plateau and void-fill artefact is rejected.
# * FACILITY-SCOPED, loose — INSIDE OpenStreetMap water-facility
#   outlines only (man_made=wastewater_plant, landuse=basin/reservoir).
#   Working ponds are NOT hydro-flat (the KBNA aeration ponds carry
#   0.3-0.5 m of lidar surface texture), so the loose thresholds would
#   over-detect hollows tile-wide (109 candidates measured) — but
