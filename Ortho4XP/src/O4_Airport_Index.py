"""Offline airport search index built from X-Plane's Global Airports.

This module builds a small, fast, offline search index of airports from
X-Plane's ``apt.dat`` (the Global Airports gateway data set).  The real
``apt.dat`` is hundreds of megabytes, so parsing is done strictly
line-by-line (streaming) and never loads the whole file into memory.

The public surface is intentionally tiny and stdlib-only (no tkinter/Qt,
no network access, no printing):

* :func:`find_apt_dats` -- locate the Global Airports ``apt.dat`` file(s).
* :func:`build_index`   -- stream-parse ``apt.dat`` into a compact cache.
* :func:`load_index`    -- fast reload from that cache.
* :func:`index_count`   -- the cache's recorded airport count (header only).
* :func:`index_is_stale` -- decide whether the cache needs rebuilding.
* :func:`search`        -- rank airports for a free-text query.
* :func:`parse_coordinate_query` -- interpret a query as tile coordinates.

This module is the SINGLE airport-index implementation every front end
uses: the Qt map consumes it in-process, and the macOS application asks
for it over the engine protocol's ``airport_index`` command (which builds
the cache off the transport read loop and replies with the cache path --
the application only READS the TSV, it never parses ``apt.dat`` itself;
see docs/specs/airport-index-engine-command-spec.md).

The cache is a compact TSV file (see :func:`build_index`) so reloads are
cheap and the on-disk format is easy to inspect.

Cache format v4 and the freshness contract
-------------------------------------------
The cache header is ``O4AIRPORTIDX 4 <count>``.  Immediately after the
header, :func:`build_index` writes one ``#SRC <mtime_ns> <size_bytes>
<path>`` line for every source ``apt.dat`` it actually read (the path is
written last because it may contain spaces; ``mtime_ns`` comes from
:func:`os.stat`'s ``st_mtime_ns`` for full precision, and the byte size is
recorded as a second freshness signal).  The tab-separated data rows are
unchanged from v3 (v3 added the trailing ``category`` column; v4 changes
only what gets INDEXED, not the row shape).  :func:`load_index`
transparently loads v1 (no ``#SRC`` lines) through v4 caches, skipping any
``#SRC`` lines.  :func:`index_is_stale` reads only the header and ``#SRC``
lines to report whether the recorded sources still match the requested
ones (same set of paths, and identical ``st_mtime_ns`` and size for each),
so callers can rebuild only when something has actually changed on disk.

    Only the header and the ``#SRC`` provenance lines of the cache are read
    (never the airport rows), so this is cheap to call on every run.  The
    cache is considered stale -- i.e. this returns ``True`` -- when ANY of
    the following hold:

    * the cache file is missing or unreadable;
    * the header is malformed (missing/incorrect magic or version);
    * the header version is below the current one (v1 caches carry no
      source info; pre-v3 caches carry no airport categories; pre-v4
      caches were built by a parse that skipped water-only seaplane
      bases, from a smaller candidate set);
    * the set of recorded source paths differs from ``apt_dat_paths``
      (compared order-insensitively after :func:`os.path.abspath`);
    * a recorded source no longer exists on disk;
    * a source's current ``st_mtime_ns`` or byte size differs from the
      recorded value (compared with ``!=`` so a restored/downgraded file
      also triggers a rebuild).

    It returns ``False`` only when every recorded source still matches.  An
    empty ``apt_dat_paths`` against a v2 cache that itself recorded zero
    sources is *fresh* (there is nothing to compare); empty paths with no
    cache is stale.
