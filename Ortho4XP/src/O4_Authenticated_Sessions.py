"""Authenticated provider sessions -- shared login + credential machinery.

Some data providers gate their downloads behind a user account (the first
is Portugal's Direcao-Geral do Territorio lidar download centre).  This
module owns everything session-related, shared by ANY provider definition
that declares a login -- elevation today, imagery or overlays tomorrow:

- a login-flow registry (mirroring the elevation access-strategy
  registry) so new authentication schemes plug in without touching any
  orchestration code;
- the ``keycloak_password`` flow: a scripted Keycloak username/password
  sign-in (fetch the hosted login form, submit credentials, follow the
  authorization-code redirect chain until the site session cookie is
  set).  Works for any Keycloak-fronted service without a CAPTCHA;
- cookie persistence as Netscape-format cookie files under the data
  root, readable both by ``requests`` (http.cookiejar.MozillaCookieJar)
  and by GDAL ``/vsicurl`` (the ``GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEFILE`` option), so the
  GUI process can sign in and the tile-build subprocess can reuse the
  session with no GUI involvement;
- credential storage through the optional ``keyring`` package, which
  backs onto the platform secret store: macOS Keychain, Windows
  Credential Locker, or the Linux Secret Service (GNOME Keyring /
  KWallet).  Passwords never touch a configuration file or the cookie
  directory.

Session definitions are plain dictionaries (in practice: parsed ``.elv``
provider definitions) using these keys:

    session_name        stable identifier shared by every provider that
                        uses the same account (e.g. "dgterritorio")
    credential_kind     "session" (default: cookie session established
                        by a login flow), "http_basic" (username and
                        password sent as HTTP Basic authentication on
                        the data reads themselves), or "api_key" (one
                        secret string, substituted for the {api_key}
                        placeholder in the provider's URLs)
    login_flow          [session kind] registered flow name
                        (e.g. "keycloak_password")
    login_url           [session kind] where the flow starts (the
                        service's sign-in entry point, NOT the identity
                        provider's)
    session_probe_url   [session/http_basic kinds] URL whose response
                        distinguishes signed-in from signed-out
                        (redirect/401/403 = signed out)
    api_key_probe_url   [api_key kind] URL with an {api_key}
                        placeholder used to validate a key at sign-in
                        time (same signed-out convention)
    registration_url    where a user can CREATE the account; shown in
                        sign-in prompts and error messages

Core module: no GUI-toolkit imports.  The Qt settings window calls
:func:`sign_in` / :func:`sign_out` / :func:`signed_in`; build-time code
calls :func:`ensure_session` and gets back a ready ``requests.Session``.
