"""Regional OpenStreetMap extracts: the local-first OSM data backend.

Serves the per-tile OSM layer caches from Geofabrik regional extracts
(daily ``.osm.pbf`` snapshots on a plain HTTPS CDN, no rate limits)
instead of querying public Overpass servers, which are shared query
infrastructure and throttle exactly the bulk-extraction workload a
batch tile build produces (docs/specs/osm-regional-extracts-spec.md).

Life cycle, designed so users never manage it by hand:

* Nothing downloads up front.  The first build touching a region
  downloads its extract IN THE FOREGROUND (owner ruling 2026-07-18:
  the Geofabrik CDN serves a whole country in about the time ONE
  throttled Overpass query round takes — measured HECA: the lazy
  fallback spent 21 minutes on Overpass while egypt.osm.pbf landed 60
  seconds after the build needed it) and then serves the build locally.
  ``osm_extract_foreground_download=False`` restores the previous lazy
  behaviour: record the region as wanted (``wanted.json``), use
  Overpass this once, and let the maintenance thread download it.
* :func:`start_background_maintenance` (called once at application
  start — Qt or CLI, never by parallel-build worker children) refreshes
  the region index when stale, re-downloads extracts older than the
  ``osm_extract_refresh_days`` setting, and drains the wanted list on a
  rescan loop.  Worker children only ever append wants: a single
  downloader can never race itself over a multi-hundred-megabyte file.

Failure discipline: this backend is an accelerator, never a
dependency.  Every public entry point swallows its own errors and
returns ``None`` / no-ops, leaving the historic Overpass path exactly
as it was.  No GUI-toolkit imports (core-module rule).
