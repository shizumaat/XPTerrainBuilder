"""Adjacent-ground grade law — the LATERAL banded emitter (slice 3).

The lateral generalization of the runway-END skirt: ground beside a
paved surface is a two-zone-plus-ungraded CORRIDOR off the pavement
EDGE (``grade_law.adjacent_ground_envelope``, single law source).  This
module MARCHES that corridor outward from every airside pavement edge
that faces unpaved ground and emits ``graded_strip`` surface polygons
wherever the smoothed DEM sits OUTSIDE the corridor:

  * DEM ABOVE the ceiling  → CUT down to the ceiling (rising terrain;
    under the enforce-fully mandate the zone-1/2 ceiling is BELOW the
    edge, so a flat surround is excavated to the lawful drainage slope).
  * DEM BELOW the floor     → FILL up to the floor (falling terrain,
    only inside zones 1-2 where the floor is finite — zone 3's floor is
    ``None``, so a cliff beyond the graded band renders as DEM: the
    boundary-bridge killer).
  * DEM INSIDE the corridor → emit NOTHING (the terrain is lawful).

The machinery is the runway-end skirt's banded emission, with both
directions inline-duplicated MINIMALLY from clearance.py (flagged for
the cleanup slice): ``_build_fill_bands`` twins ``_build_filled_skirts``
(all-band run widening, no skirt-lift ring values), ``_build_cut_bands``
mirrors it for the corridor's piecewise-continuous ceiling (the skirt's
cut twin ``_build_graded_strips`` takes a single linear slope).  Bands are
split at the law's zone breakpoints, carry per-band ``node_altitudes``,
and are clipped EXACTLY against every existing shape + the airport
boundary (weld ruling 2026-07-09: the band's inner row sits ON the
pavement ring with the pavement edge values verbatim — no standoff
groove; shared boundaries weld by shared coordinates + the guarded
value adoption below).

Runway ENDS are OUT OF SCOPE (the runway-end skirt law owns them, and
the skirt shapes are already in the static block, so the cut/fill bands
clip against them and never double-write); runway-END ring edges are
skipped by the outward-normal test the ring-edge sweep uses.

Behind ``config.ADJACENT_GROUND_LAW_ENABLED`` (env
``O4_ADJACENT_GROUND_LAW``, default off).  With the gate off this module
is never imported (the pipeline import is inside the gated block), so it
is byte-inert.

    FREE GROUND ONLY (gate ``O4_BAND_RAY_OCCLUSION``; owner ruling
    2026-07-25: "Yes for adjacent ground using a ray occlusion, it should
    stop at pavement").

    THE LAW: a lateral band's outward reach is measured through free ground
    only — a station's outward march TERMINATES at the first sample
    distance whose point falls inside the static pavement union, and the
    station's band depth becomes the LAST FREE-GROUND sample before that
    hit.  Beyond an occluding pavement the ground is that pavement's own
    frontage: its bands march outward from ITS edge and cover it, so
    stopping here leaves nothing ungoverned (and the emitted band never
    wraps a foreign pavement's corner — the CYXY shapeID 395 defect, where
    junction 129's deep cut slab marched straight through apron 132 +
    junction 131 because the lidar reads the built apron bench as terrain
    needing a cut, so daylight never closed).

    Returns one float per station — the largest lawful depth, or
    ``_OCCLUSION_CLEAR`` (+inf) where that ray is clear; a station whose
    FIRST sample is already occluded gets 0.0 (no band at all).  Returns
    ``None`` when NOTHING is occluded (and always with the gate off), which
    is the builders' structural no-op path: byte-identical.

    Sampled on the SAME ``k * step`` grid the two band builders march
    (``d = min(cap, k * step)``, ``k = 1 … ceil(cap / step)``), with
    ``band_caps`` the per-station MAX of the fill and cut caps so one march
    serves both directions.  (The cut builder samples one millimetre
    inside its cap; that 1e-3 is immaterial to a containment test and is
    deliberately not reproduced here — one march, one law.)

    ``wrap_skirt_prep`` — the taxiway-end WRAP exemption, verbatim from
    ``_station_reference_ex``: a runway-END skirt is the corridor's JOIN
    target, not an obstruction, so a hit that lies on the skirt does not
    occlude.  ``None`` (runways, aprons, wrap gate OFF): every static hit
    occludes.

    BUILD-TIME: the naive form (one prepared ``contains`` + one ``Point``
    per sample) measured 2.45 s per 700k samples — SPJC scale — against
    a 0.6 s budget, so the whole station x sample grid is tested in ONE
    vectorized ``shapely.contains_xy`` call against the same prepared
    union (measured 0.084 s for the same 700k samples, a 29x cut, and
    exactly equivalent by construction: ``contains_xy(g, x, y)`` IS
    ``g.contains(Point(x, y))``).  This is the collar-zone guard's
    precedent (450 ms naive -> 35 ms guarded) taken to the same standard.

    _edges``): a ring edge shorter than ``tear_max`` whose two endpoints'
    altitudes differ by more than ``min_jump``.

    SECOND class (``wall_max``, 2026-07-17): a WELD-ADJACENT WALL edge —
    one endpoint on the pavement weld row, the other a zone vertex, edge
    shorter than a station step (``wall_max``) with a jump exceeding both
    ``min_jump`` and the edge length (grade > 100 %).  No corridor slope
    reaches 100 %; the zone value is a resampler / solved-store escape
    riding raw DEM against the pavement row (CYXY apron #677: weld 706.4
    vs zone 712.7 over 4.0 m).  The sub-metre sentinel misses it at emit,
    but any conformance insert splitting the edge mints a flagged
    sub-metre segment.  Weld-adjacent ONLY: a fill band's outer row
    lawfully rides raw DEM, so two NON-weld vertices across a real
    terrain cliff are never collapsed.

    Cause: the ``difference()`` clips and the band END caps can pinch a
    band's INNER (pavement weld) row to within a metre of its OUTER
    (terrain) row while each keeps its own lawful value, minting a
    near-vertical face no lateral corridor slope produces (the lateral law
    tops out at ~5 %, so a >1 m step over <1 m is impossible by
    construction; it is always a clip residue / pinch, never a graded
    row).  The DEM-aware corridor validator accepts the WIDE band edges
    that ride terrain up a hillside, so the ONLY unlawful thing here is the
    sub-metre pinch edge — remove it geometrically.

    Resolution: drop ONE endpoint of each flagged edge, preferring to
    keep a weld vertex (its position is ON the pavement boundary and its
    value is the pavement weld value the conformance pass welds to —
    never move it).  Between two OUTER vertices (a clip-minted
    near-duplicate) drop the bigger spike.  Iterated to a fixed point so
    a collapse that exposes a fresh short edge is healed too.  Returns
    the healed open ring + aligned altitudes (input objects returned
    unchanged when nothing collapses).  NOTE: both classes key on the
    VALUE jump, so the healed footprint is value-dependent — the
    construct-move footprint-equality acceptance neutralizes this heal
    (see ``test_emit_admission_footprints_equal_gate_off``)."""

    The per-piece ``_heal_band_tears`` at emit runs BEFORE the piece's own
    re-deconflict ``difference()`` / remap and before neighbour bands settle,
    so a tear the LATER geometry mints escapes it.  Two classes the raster
    reach band exposes (an apron/junction the tighter, CORRECT ceiling clamps
    ~2 m down, its strips then bridging the resulting step) survive to emit:

      1. WITHIN-STRIP PINCH: a strip clips against a NOT-dropped abutting
         pavement and pinches its own host-weld row and the clip row
         sub-metre apart.
      2. CROSS-STRIP SEAM: two neighbour strips grading off pavements now
         ~2 m apart share a seam node through the emit VALUE CONSENSUS
         (``to_osm``: a shared node carries the mean of the strips touching
         it), so one strip inherits the other's value and tears against its
         own adjacent vertex — a tear invisible in the strip's OWN
         ``node_altitudes`` (it lives only in the shared consensus).

    Under the legacy band the two references sat within the tear jump, so
    neither fired; this is a raster-band reconciliation, not a new law.  The
    ruled resolution is unchanged (``_heal_band_tears`` doctrine: the sub-metre
    near-vertical edge is the ONLY unlawful thing — the DEM-aware corridor
    validator accepts the wide terrain-riding edges — so it is removed
    geometrically).  This pass detects the tear against the EFFECTIVE emitted
    value (the cross-strip shared-coordinate consensus, so class 2 is visible)
    and collapses it by dropping an UNSHARED, non-donor vertex — never a vertex
    another strip or a donor pavement also owns (moving it would un-weld that
    seam).  Runs before the group decimation (healed rings decimate cleanly)
    and before the pipeline's final epsilon-wedge weld (which re-conforms the

# corner (building pad, service road, terminal, groundside — the

# as a stacked "clean wall" twin.  This pass resolves the residue AS
# GEOMETRY before emit: the strip's conflicting boundary run retreats
# horizontally into its own interior, and a ``retaining_wall`` face
# fills the vacated band — top row ON the old boundary at the
# authority values (welds to the designed shape's chain), bottom row
# at the retreated strip edge at the strip's own values.  The level
# change survives as deliberate, horizontally-extended wall geometry.

# re-intern into the very node it retreats from.

# continuous.  Terminating at a still-coincident neighbour leaves that
# neighbour silently merged UP to the authority value beside a
# retreated vertex at the strip's own value: a shoulder step of the
# full conflict height (the CYXY #392 tear, 1.03 m over 0.99 m,

    vertices of one shape: the DEM **CLAMPED INTO the corridor** at the
    vertex's true lateral distance ``d`` to the pavement edge (shapely
    projection); ``is_weld_row`` marks a vertex ON the ring (d ≤ 2 cm),
    whose value is the pavement edge value verbatim (unrounded),

        alt = min(max(dem, edge + floor(d)), edge + ceiling(d)).

    This is the corridor law applied verbatim (round 2, coordinator
    ruling): the adjacent-ground envelope bounds BOTH sides of the
    emitted surface — unlike the runway-end skirt law, which is a FLOOR
    only, the band may NOT ride a DEM bump above the ceiling (the round-1
    "skirt lift" convention produced 100%+ internal band slopes; unlawful
    here).  Where the DEM sits inside the corridor the clamp returns the
    DEM itself, so the band meets lawful terrain with no step at
    daylight.  Values within ``_CORRIDOR_SNAP_TOL_M`` of a bound emit the
    bound (triangle diet; see the constant).

    ``kind`` keeps the piece's value function CONTINUOUS across the
    corridor's floor discontinuity at the graded width W (finite → None):

      * ``"fill"`` pieces live in zones 1-2 by construction (their band
        cap IS W), so ``d`` clamps to W — outer-row vertices whose
        projection jitters past W stay on the shelf edge instead of
        plunging to the DEM (the round-2 CYXY 25 m in-piece cliff).
      * ``"cut"`` pieces are CEILING-only (floor unapplied): below-floor
        terrain inside a cut piece belongs to the FILL machinery (the
        fill bands emit first and own that footprint — the cut/fill split
        of the flat-shadow convention), and the ceiling is continuous
        over all three zones, so a cut piece spanning the W boundary has
        no value step.

    ``envelope_at(d) -> (floor_offset, ceiling_offset)`` is the family's
    law corridor (``grade_law.adjacent_ground_envelope`` partial).  The
    edge elevation is read by linear-referencing the query's foot along
    the ring against the per-vertex ``ring_alts`` (``None`` entries —
    pavement-facing / unsampled vertices — filled from their nearest
    known neighbour so a foot landing there still resolves).

    (``zone_rows`` + the writeback's ``zone_values``); ``coords`` /
    ``ring_alts`` are the FINAL solved pavement ring the emit-time march
    ran on.

    Value rule, in precedence order (coordinator ruling 2026-07-11):
      1. WELD ROW (lateral distance <= 2 cm): the pavement edge value
         verbatim — pavement identity, unchanged from the analytic path.
      2. EXACT VARIABLE: a vertex within the canonical-registry
         tolerance (0.5 m) of a solved zone node takes that variable's
         solved value — registry identity, the mechanism that retires
         the adoption/weld apparatus.
      3. ROW INTERPOLATION: otherwise the vertex takes LINEAR
         INTERPOLATION ALONG THE SOLVED ROW it lands on (arc-length
         weighted between the bracketing solver-valued stations —
         the ruled clip-minted-vertex valuation), and where it sits
         BETWEEN two rows, the depth-weighted blend of the two rows'
         interpolants (the value the solved, piecewise-linear band
         surface already implies at that point; the pavement edge
         itself serves as the depth-0 row).  Sound BECAUSE the band law
         has no neighbour coupling — every zone value is independent,
         so regrouping independently-valued vertices onto the emit-time
         footprint cannot violate anything (the order-2 scout
         refutation, ratified).
      4. NO SOLVED ROW in range (an emit-time run the pre-solve
         estimate did not cover): the analytic resampler values the
         vertex and the case is COUNTED loudly
         (``solved_analytic_fallback`` — the B2 degrade convention).

    EMIT-SIDE CORRIDOR CLAMP (``O4_BAND_CORRIDOR_CLAMP``, 2026-07-25 —
    full rationale in the config block ``BAND_CORRIDOR_CLAMP_ENABLED``).
    Rules 2-4 above take their value from the SOLVED field, which the
    canonical-point registry interns ACROSS SHAPES: a foreign shape's zone
    node within 0.5 m of this shape's own can claim the variable, and this
    shape's band then emits a value its OWN corridor forbids (SPJC: 34.49 m
    where the apron shoulder corridor is [36.00, 36.06] — a 1.56 m notch).
    So every solved value is finally clamped into this shape's analytic
    corridor ``[edge_alt + floor_off(d), edge_alt + ceil_off(d)]`` — the
    IDENTICAL bounds ``_make_edge_projection_resampler`` enforces by
    construction, read from the same ``grade_law.adjacent_ground_envelope``
    partial and with the same ``kind`` continuity treatment (fill clamps
    ``d`` to the graded width; cut drops the floor).  The weld row (rule 1)
    is pavement identity and is never clamped; the analytic fallback
    (rule 4) is already inside the corridor by construction.  Where the
    clamp bites, this shape and its neighbour emit different values at one
    canonical point — the emitter's supported "deliberate wall of two
    separate nodes" node-split convention (see the adoption block's own
    comment further down this module), not a tear.

    ``envelope_at`` / ``graded_width_m`` are this shape's family corridor
    closure and band cap (``_band_family_closures``); ``None`` (or the gate
    off) disables the clamp and restores the pre-fix values verbatim.

    target, not an obstruction) so the corridor wraps the taxiway end onto
    the skirt.  ``None`` (default; runways, aprons, gate OFF): the probe
    skips every static hit exactly as before — byte-identical.

    ``ring_alts_fill`` (Slice B stage B3 order 3, coverage closure; passed
    only by the pre-solve construct march under band admission): a SECOND
    per-vertex edge-altitude array — the reach-band CEILING — used for FILL
    detection, while the positional ``ring_alts`` carries the reach-band
    FLOOR used for CUT detection (see ``_worst_case_ring_alts``).  ``None``
    (default; every post-solve/emit caller): both directions read the single
    ``ring_alts`` — byte-identical to before order 3.

    ``crossing_zone_prep`` (Phase 1, docs/specs/crossing-terrain-
    ownership.md; supersedes the round-6 road-lane exclusion): the
    PREPARED published crossing influence zone (``_crossing_zone_prep``).
    A station whose seed point OR outward probe falls inside the zone is
    dropped exactly like the end-edge / covered-probe skips, so the
    taxiway-end wrap fan never sweeps into a crossing or its depressed
    road corridor (bands never wrap a ramp/approach end — user ruling
    2026-07-15).  ``None`` (default; nothing published — no crossings, no
    depressed road): no zone test — byte-identical.

    ``prolonged_keys`` (tile-seam prolongation, pre-solve constructor
    only): the vertex keys of the SYNTHETIC ring vertices
    ``_seam_prolonged_ring`` spliced in.  Purely informational — each zone
    row records, per point, whether its station sits on a PROLONGED ring
    edge (``host_pro``), which is what the constructor's host repair needs
    to know to keep the law corridor referenced to the prolonged frontage
    rather than to the cut-back corner.  ``None`` (default; every emit
    caller, every ring with no prolongation): all flags False —
    byte-identical.

    ``collar_zone_prep`` (arc B1, ``_collar_zone_prep``): the PREPARED
    published COLLARED-POCKET zone — the pockets whose drainage collar
    rings actually emitted.  Tested exactly like the crossing zone, for
    EVERY family (a pocket is ringed by mixed roles — runway, taxiway and
    apron edges all face the same hole), so the collar and the bands
    never govern the same ground.  ``None`` (default; nothing collared):
    no zone test — byte-identical.

    ``fill_station_filter`` (APRON WALL SCOPE, owner ruling 2026-07-25 —
    passed only for APRON shapes with ``O4_APRON_WALL_SCOPE`` ON; see
    ``apron_wall_frontage_qualifier``): ``qualifies(sx, sy) -> bool``.  A
    station it rejects faces OPEN TERRAIN, which the ruling leaves
    UNGOVERNED ON THE FILL SIDE — the raw DEM grades right up to the apron
    edge — so its FILL reference is nulled and no fill band, and therefore
    no fill zone row, is built there.  The CUT side is untouched: terrain
    standing above the clearance ceiling is a wingtip obstruction wherever
    it stands.  ``None`` (default; every other family, gate off): no
    filtering — byte-identical."""

    outer-edge altitude (reuses the ``ROLE_RETAINING_WALL`` emit contract
    — a thin vertical band, top row at the shoulder edge, bottom row at
    the DEM).  Grouped into runs of consecutive dropped stations.

    APRON WALL CONTINUITY (``O4_APRON_WALL_CONTINUITY``, 2026-07-25; full
    diagnosis in the config block ``APRON_WALL_CONTINUITY_ENABLED``) adds
    two things the owner's "ramps and sharp drops" report traced to:

      * MULTIPART-SAFE emission.  The clip against static pavement, the
        just-emitted graded strips and the boundary can split ONE wall run
        into several pieces — a neighbouring junction band nicking 5.29 m²
        out of a 173 m frontage was enough.  The pre-fix code emitted only
        a single ``Polygon`` residue and dropped every other run WHOLE
        (SPJC: 4 runs / 240.4 m² of owed wall face).  The residue is now
        decomposed exactly the way the graded-band emitter decomposes its
        own (``_repair_self_lenses`` → ``_decompose_polygon_with_holes``)
        and every surviving part is emitted; ``_nearest_alt`` values each
        part against the run's own top/bottom rows unchanged.  Parts below
        ``APRON_WALL_MIN_RUN_M`` / ``APRON_WALL_MIN_AREA_M2`` are confetti
        and are skipped and COUNTED (never silently capped).
      * RUN HYSTERESIS.  A run STARTS only above the full
        ``APRON_EDGE_WALL_MIN_DROP_M``, but CONTINUES through stations down
        to ``… - APRON_WALL_RUN_HYSTERESIS_M`` — stations millimetres under
        the threshold (SPJC: 1.4988 m, 1.4936 m) no longer chop a
        continuous frontage into pieces with a bare notch between.

    Gate OFF ⇒ ``join`` collapses onto ``start`` and the single-Polygon
    emission returns, i.e. byte-identical to the pre-fix emitter.

    ``station_filter`` (APRON WALL SCOPE, owner ruling 2026-07-25 —
    ``apron_wall_frontage_qualifier``, gated by ``O4_APRON_WALL_SCOPE``):
    ``qualifies(sx, sy) -> bool``.  A wall is emitted ONLY at stations with
    another built pavement shape within
    ``APRON_WALL_PAVEMENT_ADJACENCY_M`` — between two built surfaces there
    is no room to grade, so a vertical face is the only lawful answer.
    Frontage facing OPEN TERRAIN takes no wall at all (and, in the march
    above, no fill band either): the raw DEM grades up to the apron edge.
