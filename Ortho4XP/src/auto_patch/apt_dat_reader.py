"""Parser for X-Plane ``apt.dat`` airport data files.

Loads runway, pavement (taxiway / apron / ramp) and boundary geometry
for a single airport.  This is the *patch-mesh authoritative* source
for airport pavement shapes — apt.dat polygons are exactly what the
X-Plane simulator renders as the pavement texture, so elevation
patches generated against these polygons align perfectly with the
ground texture (no visible seams).

Compared to OSM aerodrome data:

* apt.dat polygons are **disjoint by construction** — no overlapping
  shapes to subtract, no precision-drift artefacts.
* Taxiways are stored as **outline polygons**, not centerlines that
  we have to buffer to a guessed width.
* Curved taxiway shoulders use **Bezier control points** (rows 112,
  114) which we sample into polygon vertices.
* Each pavement carries its **surface type**, **roughness** and
  **orientation** so downstream code can apply per-surface grade
  rules.

Compared to CIFP, apt.dat does NOT have per-runway-threshold
elevations — runway row 100 only stores lat/lon, width, and
displaced-threshold offsets.  CIFP is still the source of truth for
runway elevations.

The parser is read-only and side-effect-free: given a path to an
``apt.dat`` file and an ICAO code, it returns an :class:`Airport`
object containing the parsed geometry.  Use :func:`find_airport_apt_dat`
to locate the right ``apt.dat`` for a given airport, preferring a
per-airport Custom Scenery pack over the global one.

# ≈ metres at airport latitudes).  Many apt.dat authors use Beziers
# just to soften 90° corners by 1-2 m for visual smoothness — the
# default 4-segment tessellation turns each into a 5-vertex arc that
# downstream residue/junction passes treat as real boundary detail
# and end up wrapping junction polygons around.  At SPJC stub C, two
# such corner-softening Beziers (chord deviations 1.04 m and 0.39 m)
# created the "wrong-side" junction vertex.  Real curves (taxiway

# lazily by :func:`_index_apt_dat` on first access; subsequent
# `_file_has_airport` / `_file_has_airport_with_pavement` calls become
# O(1) dict lookups.
#
# Why this matters: the auto-patch pipeline calls
# ``build_airport_pavement(icao, ...)`` once per airport in a tile, and
# each call invokes ``find_airport_apt_dat`` and
# ``find_all_airport_apt_dats``.  Before the cache, every airport
# invocation re-scanned every apt.dat file in the X-Plane install
# (Custom Scenery + Global + default), which on a typical setup with
# ~25 airports per tile pulled ~10 GB through the line scanner per
# tile build.  After the cache, each apt.dat is scanned exactly once
# per process.

# Global Airports file alone is hundreds of MB); that cost is otherwise
# paid afresh by every cold process — each ``build_airport_pavement``
# run from a tool/dev loop AND every pytest-xdist worker.  Persisting the
# index to a temp file lets all of them skip the rescan after the first
# warm run.  Keys embed ``(path, mtime_ns, size)`` so a rewritten or
# moved file simply misses and is rescanned — a stale or partial cache
# file is always SAFE (mismatched keys are ignored), so loads/saves are

    Model (user 2026-06-29): the routing graph is grouped by **network
    connectivity**, never by NAME.  Routes are the maximal chains of sized taxi
    edges that run through degree-2 nodes, split ONLY at genuine junctions
    (network degree ≥ 3) and runway contacts.  A route that merely changes name
    along its length — an unnamed apron lane continuing into a named taxiway
    (CYXY ~U12 → F) — stays ONE continuous polyline, so the spine never sees a
    manufactured gap at the name boundary (the old per-NAME grouping severed it
    into two dangling pieces and dead-ended the spine).

    The ICAO size travels PER SEGMENT, straight off each edge's ``kind``
    (``taxiway_C`` → "C"), so width / grade-cap is a property of the geometry, not
    a name→letter table — a route may change width along its length and each
    segment keeps its own size.

    Each connectivity route is then bend-split (``split_merged_centerline``: RDP +
    curve-skip) for the rect decomposition exactly as before; the bend splits land
    on shared vertices, so the spine still connects across them — only the
    name-induced splits (which could fall on a vertexless interior point) are
    gone.  Each emitted piece re-derives its per-segment size from the parent
    route, so size is preserved through the split.
