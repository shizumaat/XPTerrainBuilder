"""Taxi/road bridges + tunnel portals + depressed-road segments.

Five emitters:

* ``_emit_tunnel_portals`` — short ramp polygons at tunnel-OSM
  entrance / exit so the road dives under airport pavement.
* ``_scenery_has_bridge_objects`` — DSF-pavement check that gates
  bridge emission (no point emitting bridge polygons if the
  underlying scenery already provides bridge meshes).
* ``_emit_taxi_bridges`` — taxi-over-road bridges.
* ``_emit_underpass_road_approaches`` — road approaches sloping
  down toward an underpass.
* ``_emit_through_airport_depressed_roads`` — road segments
  depressed below airport surface where they cut through.

**All five are gated by ``EMIT_BRIDGES_AND_TUNNELS`` in
``O4_Pavement_Config`` (currently True).**  Each emitter carves
its footprint out of overlapping airside / groundside pavement
before emitting so ``test_no_self_overlap`` stays green.

    * MAPPED ``tunnel=yes`` ways of the same public classes are
      RE-SPLIT by the same pavement intersections (gate
      ``O4_TUNNEL_TAXI_BREAKS``): the OSM mapper's tunnel-segment
      endpoints land wherever they were drawn, so breaks came at the
      taxiway edge for implied bores but at arbitrary spots for
      mapped ones ("some seem to be doing that, and others not").
      Deriving every break from OUR pavement makes them uniform.  A
      mapped tunnel that crosses NO taxi/runway pavement is a road
      built over (terminal buildings, aprons) — retagged
      ``building_passage``: no trench, no ramps, but ramp walks
      still refuse to route through it.
    * Every break lands ``TAXI_EDGE_BREAK_MARGIN_M`` (1 m) OUTSIDE
      the pavement edge, so the portal's 1 m retaining-wall cap
      occupies exactly [edge, edge+1 m] — wall at the taxiway edge,
      ramp low end right behind it.
    * Consecutive bores along one way whose surface gap is shorter
      than ``low_connector_max_gap_m`` (too short to ramp up to DEM
      and back — the double-parallel-taxiway case) MERGE into one
      long bore and the gap is recorded in ``low_connector_gaps``
      as ``(gap_line, corridor_width_m)``: the caller emits it as a
      single flat rect at the low elevation with retaining walls,
      instead of two facing overlapping ramps.  Gate

    Two portals FACE each other when they belong to different ways of

    stations lie between ``min_gap_m`` and ``max_gap_m``, and each one's
    outward approach heads at the other.  The mutual test is what keeps
    a merely NEARBY bore — a parallel service road, the far end of the
    same system — out of the set.

    ``min_gap_m`` is A8's first case read here: portals within
    ``portal_cluster_dist_m`` are COMBINED-ENTRANCE SIBLINGS, one
    entrance that ``_cluster_portals`` merges — there is no gap between
    them to lower, and treating them as facing minted a degenerate
    corridor sliver (measured KCLT: 3.6 m² between two stations ~2 m
    apart).  A gap has to be a gap.

    A3 (owner ruling 2026-08-11): such a pair is not two tunnels with an
    approach between them, it is ONE lowered stretch of road — "the two
    close together tunnel mouths indicate the whole area is lowered …
    and flat between the two mouths".  The gap therefore emits an open
    CUT (:func:`_emit_facing_corridors`) and neither portal emits
    ramp-to-grade geometry into it; ramps to grade remain the job of the
    system's OUTER approaches.

    pavement it surfaces through: it cuts that pavement, through the same
    helper ruling R13 uses over an open pit.

    Runs before the pavement-overlap clip, on the ramp pieces this
    emission produced.  Two steps:

      1. SAFETY FLOOR — a ramp piece whose area is ≥
         ``_RAMP_RUNWAY_DROP_FRACTION`` on a ``_RAMP_NEVER_CUT_ROLES``
         shape is DROPPED with a ``vprint(1)`` naming its source way and
         the shape.  A ramp never cuts the runway family, so the runway
         roles are also absent from :func:`_tunnel_ramp_cut_roles`.
      2. The surviving ramps' CLEARANCE ANNULUS cuts the pavement.

    ``clearance_m`` (spec ``tunnel-ramp-cut-boundaries-spec.md`` §2 —
    W/G-1) is what makes the cut a CLEARANCE ANNULUS instead of the bare
    ramp union, and it is the geometric fix for the whole minting class
    the parent round produced.  Ruling 4 removed the 0.6 m graze push,
    so a new ramp corner could land INSIDE a solved pavement vertex's
    ``SHARED_VERTEX_TOL_M`` (0.5 m) intern bucket; ``layout.to_osm``'s
    authority precedence then welded one value across what is physically
    a retaining wall (OTHH: 148 ways byte-identical in geometry with
    drifted altitudes; the ``-11816`` fork throat adopting junction node
    ``-1498``'s 3.60 against its own uniform 1.30).  Cutting the
    pavement back by ``wall_gap_m + retaining_wall_width_m`` — the SAME
    geometry the continuous perimeter wall band occupies — leaves no
    remaining pavement vertex within the bucket of any ramp ring, so
    cross-boundary interning is geometrically impossible and every cut
    edge reads pavement | wall | ramp.

    Returns the airside pavement union AS IT NOW STANDS — the SAME
    object when nothing was cut, so the caller's clip is byte-identical
    on airports with no ramp/pavement overlap.  The rebuild is R13's
    union bookkeeping (``_reindex_owned_ground``): without it a portal
    wall would be dropped for overlapping pavement its own ramp just
    removed.

    bore-depth LEVEL across the mouths and the roadway between two facing
    portals, then climbing at ``TUNNEL_APPROACH_GRADE`` back to whatever
    the solver gave it — instead of a synthetic rectangle being emitted
    beside it.  A synthetic corridor next to at-grade road pavement is a
    CLIFF (measured KCLT: an 8.31 m step across the 0.6 m graze
    standoff), and that cliff is the defect class this law removes.

    The claim never RAISES a vertex: each one takes the lower of its
    solved value and the tunnel profile, so the claim can only dig, and
    it dies out on its own where the profile climbs back through the
    surrounding surface.

    AIRSIDE IS KING: an apron or any aircraft-transit shape inside the
    extent is never claimed and never sunk.  It mints a counted
    ``tunnel_airside_conflict`` finding instead — at KCLT that is almost
    certainly road pavement the scorer mis-roled, and that verdict
    belongs to the classify instrument, not to this emitter.

    """For each tunnel portal (each end of an OSM ``aeroway=*``
    ``tunnel=yes|building_passage`` way), emit the visible road-
    surface structure that transitions outside-DEM elevation down
    to ``apt_elev − tunnel_depth_m`` at the portal:

      1. A flat ``ROLE_RETAINING_WALL`` CAP polygon AT the portal
         node (perpendicular to road direction at portal).  The
         cap's centre line is the portal node — its width spans
         the road (carriageway width + wall_gap on each side),
         its thickness is ``retaining_wall_width_m`` (1 m).
      2. Two flat ``ROLE_RETAINING_WALL`` ARM polygons reaching
         OUTWARD from the cap along the surface roadway, on each
         side of the carriageway.  The arms follow the OSM
         surface road's polyline — multi-segment when the road
         curves.  Arm length adapts to terrain: we first walk up
         to ``arm_max_length_m`` (default 500 m), sample DEM at
         the far end, then truncate the walk so the grade from
         ``apt_elev − tunnel_depth_m`` (portal) up to that DEM
         height never exceeds ``max_ramp_grade``.  Floor at
         ``ramp_min_length_m`` (default 200 m) so a flat road
         still gets a substantial visible approach.
      3. A chain of sloped ``ROLE_TUNNEL_RAMP`` polygons matching
         the surface-road segments under the arms.  Each segment's
         elevation interpolates linearly from
         ``apt_elev − tunnel_depth_m`` at the portal to outside
         DEM at the far end of the walk, in proportion to its
         cumulative distance from the portal.

    Per user 2026-04-29 (SPJC review): the previous geometry put
    the cap PAST the portal INSIDE the airport, with arms going
    AWAY from the tunnel only as far as the OSM way extended
    outside the airport.  That made SPJC's SW tunnel "too short
    and inside the tunnel" because the OSM way ended right at the
    boundary.  Walking the SURFACE road OUTWARD from the OSM
    portal node correctly lands the cap at the tunnel mouth and
    the arms on the highway approach.

    Two-carriageway tunnels (divided highways) cluster by portal-
    node proximity (within ``portal_cluster_dist_m``).  Each
    carriageway in a cluster gets its own arm pair; the caps form
    a perpendicular line across all member portals.

    Boundary coordination: subtract the tunnel-polygon union
    (buffered by ``boundary_clearance_m``, default 1 m which
    exceeds the OSM-emit vertex bucket size of 0.5 m so boundary
    nodes never collapse onto wall nodes) from every
    ``ROLE_BOUNDARY`` shape.

    Returns the number of tunnel PORTALS emitted (each contributing
    1 cap + 2 arm walls + a ramp chain).

    near a bridge taxi rect.

    Detection logic (per user 2026-04-29):
      1. Find the DSF for the scenery pack via
         ``O4_DSF_Reader.find_associated_dsf``.
      2. Convert it to text with DSFTool when not already cached
         (``dsf_reader.ensure_dsf_text_path`` — dump lives under the
         data root, never inside the scenery pack).
      3. Walk OBJECT_DEF lines.  Mark a def as a "bridge def" when
         its path matches ``bridge|elevated|viaduct|overpass``
         AND does NOT match ``sign|signage|trafficsign|wall|
         truss|crane`` — KPHX has 3 ``lib/g10/roadsigns/SignBridge
         *.obj`` defs that are road sign gantries, NOT taxi
         bridges, and the exclude regex filters them out.
      4. Walk OBJECT placement lines.  When a placement uses a
         "bridge def" AND its lat/lon lies within
         ``bridge_proximity_m`` of any taxi rect with
         ``is_bridge=True``, return True.

    Confirmed signal at the test set:
      KBNA  — 23 OBJECT_DEFs match ``Objects/KBNA Bridges/...``
              (KBNA_Bridge_Taxiway-L_p1..p6, KBNA_Crossing_Bridge,
              elevated_edge_twy_B, ...) — many placements within
              the bridge taxi rect → True.
      KPHX  — only ``lib/g10/roadsigns/SignBridge*`` defs which
              the exclude regex drops → False.

    Feature B gate replacement (``O4_OBJECT_BRIDGE_TERRAIN``): when the
    object-terrain classifier has run (its result cached on the layout by
    ``object_terrain_assembly.attach_bridge_classification``), that
    geometry-based bridge recognition supersedes the name-grep below — it
    catches the EDDF crossings and the Spanish-named KMCO "puente" objects
    the ``bridge|elevated|viaduct|overpass`` regex misses entirely (spec
    section 3.2, step 4).  A pack is treated as carrying its own 3D bridge
    structure when the classifier found ANY bridge record; the legacy
    name-grep runs unchanged whenever the gate is off (no cached result).

    ``Objects/KBNA Bridges/KBNA_Bridge_Taxiway-L_*.obj``), the

    the scenery has NO bridge OBJ (KPHX), our emitted walls
    provide the only visible side-face structure.

    No end-cap walls — the bridge's short edges connect to
    adjacent taxis or junctions at apt_elev (the deck continues
    onto the surrounding airport surface), so an end-cap would
    visually block that join.

    Boundary coordination: when a bridge rect lies inside the
    airport boundary (typical at SPJC / KBNA / KPHX), the walls
    are also inside.  The inside-airport portion of (rect ∪
    walls) gets buffered by ``boundary_clearance_m`` (0.5 m) and
    subtracted from each ``ROLE_BOUNDARY`` shape — same pattern

    DEM in ``ramp_step_m`` increments, emitting one sloped
    ``ROLE_TUNNEL_RAMP`` quad per step.  Returns True when any quad was
    emitted.

    2026-07-15 rework (KBNA Donelson defects A+B, measured on the
    emitted patch):

    * **Shared facing edges.**  ONE corner pair is computed per chain
      station and used verbatim by both adjoining quads — the chain is
      contiguous by construction (zero facing gap, zero overlap on
      curved roads; the per-step independent rects overlapped under
      curvature and the registry then dropped every other step — the
      six measured terrain holes).
    * **Chain identity in the registry.**  A chain's quads are compared
      only against pieces registered BEFORE this chain started; the
      registry's purpose is cross-crossing / twin-carriageway
      protection (audit invariant 1), never self-comparison.
    * **[H,L,L,H] corner order.**  Quads are emitted with ring corners
      0,3 at the HIGH end, matching ``corner_alts_from_high_low`` (the
      legacy emitter's explicit reorder).  The fixed near-end-first
      order shipped every climbing rect INVERTED — the floor value on
      the FAR edge, a 2-4 m sawtooth per step (measured: rect -11066
      carried 161.0 on the edge away from the 161.01 plate).
    * **Plate weld** (``weld_edge``, deck corridors only): the first
      quad's near edge copies the corridor plate's two exit-edge ring
      coordinates VERBATIM (0.5 m interning makes them shared nodes —
      the weld), and the lateral offset between the plate axis and the
      road line decays linearly to zero over the next 3 stations so
      curved roads still track.  The near edge keeps the plate's floor
      elevation (fraction 0 of the floor→DEM interpolation); the far
      edge keeps the chain's existing climb values.

    ``refuse_inverted`` — the tunnel-portal inversion guard (user
    2026-07-10, the runway-02C climb): the mouth floor must never sit
    above the ground the chain welds to at its NEAR end — a floor above
    the adjacent road means the datum was wrong (embankment top instead
    of the road), producing a ramp climbing INTO the crossing and
    poking above the descending terrain.  The FAR end is deliberately
    not tested: terrain legitimately falls away from a mouth along the
    road (measured KBNA 02C west: 180 m at the face down to 174 m at
    240 m out).  Deck-carried BRIDGE corridors skip the guard entirely:
    a causeway over low ground sends its road DOWN to the valley."""

    Runs pre-solve (called from the pipeline's seam-anchor hook region).
    No-op without a cached classification (gate off).  Returns the number
    of pinned vertices; abutment ends that pin NO vertex (pavement cut
    short of the abutment) are logged — the analytic causeway/approach
    emitters own that gap and take the same pin value (audited by W-V).

    W1b — THE DECK-FLUSH OUTCOME (owner ruling 2026-07-31, ``config.
    OBJECT_BRIDGE_DECK_FLUSH``).  ``road_carried`` spans are pinned here
    too.  Such a span already takes no causeway, no corridor and no
    trench — the road machinery owns the crossing — but it took no pins
    either, so nothing made the terrain meet its deck where it lands;
    that is the whole of the owner's report, and at OTHH it is where all
    three of the pack's road bridges end up.  Pinning adds ONLY the two
    end values: no causeway plate, no corridor, no trench, because those
    all read the ``corridor`` set and this set is not it.

    IMPLEMENTATION NOTE — smaller than the plan's letter, deliberately.
    The plan asked for a NEW partition outcome beside the existing four.
    Measured, the outcome already exists: ``road_carried`` means exactly
    "no causeway, no corridor, no trench", which is three quarters of the
    deck-flush contract, and every one of its consumers wants that
    unchanged.  What was missing was its pins.  A sixth return value that
    always equalled an existing one would have churned fourteen unpack
    sites to carry no information.

    Deck-flush pins may attach to GROUNDSIDE pavement (owner ruling: a
    bridge may pin groundside); airside pins keep the airside-only set.

    ⚠ AND THAT WIDENING IS NOT A CONVENIENCE — IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT
    CAN EVER FIRE HERE.  A road-carried span takes an AIRSIDE deck-end
    pin never, by construction, at any airport.  Proof:
    ``_bridge_is_road_carried`` returns True exactly when no shape whose
    role is in ``_BRIDGE_PIN_ROLES | {service road, service junction}``
    intersects ``deck footprint buffered by BRIDGE_ABUTMENT_PIN_CAPTURE_
    BAND_M``.  An abutment line lies ON the deck footprint edge, so every
    shape within the capture band of that line is inside the same
    buffered footprint.  Any airside shape close enough to pin would
    therefore have made the span NOT road-carried in the first place.
    ``ROLE_GROUNDSIDE_PAVEMENT`` is the one role in the pin set that is
    absent from the road-carried test, so it is the sole escape.

    Measured 2026-07-31, and the result is ZERO pins at both airports
    tested: at OTHH the nearest groundside pavement is 139-790 m from the
    six deck ends (nearest ANY pinnable role: 139 m), at EGLL likewise
    for 4.obj.  These bridges stand in open ground the patch does not
    pave.  The feature is correct and inert there; making the owner's
    ruling visible at OTHH needs terrain EMITTED at the deck ends, not a
    pin on a pavement ring that does not exist."""

    doctrine applied fully; replaces the post-solve trench emission and
    the late causeway plates).

    Per corridor (DECK_CARRIED / cosmetic, not road-carried) bridge:

    * **Building-pad removal** (the never-stack rule): the Phase 1 DSF
      building machinery footprint-extracts the bridge OBJECTS
      themselves into flat building pads over the decks (KBNA:
      ``building2`` covered the taxiway-L footprint 2959/2959 m² — the
      measured coverer that ate the trench in every gated build).  A
      building pad mostly inside ANY classified bridge footprint is a
      stacking artifact and is removed, logged per pad.
    * **Ruling R8 flush seat**: pavement cut over a genuine hard deck
      (``cut_pavement_over_footprint``); a cosmetic deck keeps its
      pavement (R2 pavement wins) and the trench carves around it.
    * **Trench** (:data:`layout.ROLE_BRIDGE_TRENCH`): the under-deck
      footprint inset 0.6 m (> the 0.5 m weld tolerance — the R2
      node-split wall against the causeway lip), densified to ~5 m
      vertex spacing, per-vertex ``node_altitudes`` at the law floor
      (``_bridge_corridor_floor_m``, amendment A10 geometry-driven).
    * **Causeway** (:data:`layout.ROLE_BRIDGE_CAUSEWAY`): the flat plate
      from each abutment lip back along the outward approach axis to
      the first pavement edge (+2 m weld overlap, clipped by the
      pavement union — R2), capped at
      ``config.BRIDGE_CAUSEWAY_MAX_LENGTH_M``; per-vertex
      ``node_altitudes`` at ``grade_law.bridge_deck_end_pin_elevation_m``
      (the SAME law function as the pins and the validator).

    Both roles are outside every mutation pass by construction: not
    pavement (solver never reshapes them), not road features (deconflict
    never walks them), no within-shape grade rule
    (``config.ROLE_GRADE_LIMITS`` ``None``).  Returns

    back up to DEM after.

    Per user 2026-04-29 (KBNA / KPHX taxi-bridge case): without
    these polygons, the patch's mesh under a bridge sits at
    apt_elev (interpolated from the surrounding airport pavement),
    and OSM-tagged roads rendered at DEM elevation by Ortho4XP's
    road layer get buried.  Emitting a chain of road-following
    polygons forces the mesh under the road to step down to a
    height low enough for the road to clear the bridge underside
    (default 8 m below airport surface), then ramp back up to DEM
    away from the airport.

    Algorithm per underpass surface (bridge rect or tunnel portal
    region):

      1. Find OSM road LineStrings that cross the surface's
         footprint (or pass within 5 m of its long edges, for
         tunnel portals where the road just barely touches).
      2. For each crossing road, find the exterior segments
         immediately approaching and departing the surface.
      3. Walk each approach segment in ``ramp_step_m`` (20 m)
         increments, emitting a sloped 4-corner rect per step
         where elevation interpolates between DEM (start) and
         ``apt_elev − clearance_depth_m`` (end).
      4. Inside the underpass surface itself, emit a flat road-
         following polygon at ``apt_elev − clearance_depth_m``.

    Width of every emitted road polygon: ``road_width_m``
    (22 m by default; matches tunnel-ramp width).

    Returns the number of UNDERPASS surfaces processed.

    """For each public road that ENTERS the airport boundary
    AND passes under a tagged ``aeroway=*, bridge=yes`` way (or
    is connected via OSM-graph node-sharing to a road that does)
    inside the airport, emit:

      1. A flat road-following polygon along the entire inside-
         boundary stretch at ``apt_elev − depression_depth_m``.
         Subsequent OSM road rendering (Ortho4XP's own road
         layer) sits on top of this flat plate.
      2. At each boundary entry/exit point, a ramp polygon
         OUTSIDE the airport that climbs from the depressed
         level back up to the local DEM, capped at
         ``max_ramp_grade`` (default 4 %).

    Per user 2026-04-29 (KPHX Sky Harbor Blvd): when a road
    passes under multiple airport bridges, the road MUST be
    depressed for its entire inside-airport stretch — not just
    at the bridges.  Two bridges spanning the same continuous
    road imply the road can never come back up between them.
    The general solution: any road that enters the airport
    boundary and crosses any aeroway=bridge inside is treated
    this way, plus any road CONNECTED to it via shared OSM
    nodes within the boundary (so on/off ramps inside the
    airport stay coherent with the main road).

    OSM tags consulted:
      * ``aeroway=*, bridge=yes|viaduct`` — bridge LineStrings
        (the airport surface above the depression).
      * ``highway=*`` (motorway, trunk, primary, secondary,
        tertiary, residential, service + their *_link forms) —
        the road network candidates.
      * ``bridge=yes|viaduct`` on a highway — that road is
        ITSELF a bridge over something else (skip; we're
        looking for the road UNDERNEATH).
      * ``tunnel=yes|building_passage`` on a highway — INCLUDED
        as seeds (the airport-bridge case typically tags the
        under-bridge road segment as building_passage in OSM).
        ``_emit_tunnel_portals`` is told to skip every OSM way
        depressed here so we don't double-emit.

    Boundary coordination: the union of every emitted polygon
    is buffered by ``boundary_clearance_m`` and subtracted from
    each ``ROLE_BOUNDARY`` shape (same pattern as the tunnel
    and taxi-bridge emitters), with NN-resampling of per-vertex
    altitudes so the boundary ribbon retains its altitude tags
    after the clip.

    Returns ``(n_emitted, depressed_way_ids)``.  The way-id
    set is intended for ``_emit_tunnel_portals`` to skip — it
    contains every OSM highway way (raw road network) handled
    by this pass, so the explicit-tunnel emitter doesn't
    double-process the same building_passage segments.
