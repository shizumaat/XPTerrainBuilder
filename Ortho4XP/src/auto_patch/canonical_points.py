"""Canonical-point registry for shared-vertex management.

The pavement builder constructs many shapes (rects, junctions, aprons,
boundary pieces) whose perimeters meet at intersection points.  Each
of those meeting points should be a SINGLE geometric vertex shared
by every adjacent shape — at exact floating-point equality, so that
``pav_union.difference(rects)`` and the OSM emitter's vertex
bucketing produce one node ID per real-world point.

Without a shared registry, each shape's corner is snapped
independently to ``pav.boundary`` and ends up at a slightly
different location than its neighbour's "same" corner.  The
sub-millimetre to multi-metre drift cascades downstream:
``buffer(0)`` validity repairs, sliver-corner removal, T-junction
splits, and merge-corner-junctions all exist as workarounds for
this single root cause.

A canonical-point registry replaces independent snapping with a
deterministic ``get_or_add`` lookup.  Every shape that needs a
corner near (x, y) queries the registry; if any prior shape has
already registered a canonical point within
``SHARED_VERTEX_TOL_M``, the same coordinates are returned.
Otherwise (x, y) becomes the new canonical point for that bucket.

Seeded with the input fixed-geometry vertices (apt.dat row-110
pavement polygon vertices + runway corners) so the canonical
set is anchored to real apt.dat data rather than to whatever
rect happened to register a point first.
