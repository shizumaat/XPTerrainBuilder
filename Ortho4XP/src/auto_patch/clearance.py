"""Wingtip / RESA terrain-clearance grading.

Aircraft wingspans exceed the paved width of taxiways and runways, so
the design standards (FAA AC 150/5300-13 Taxiway Object Free Area;
ICAO Annex 14 graded runway strip + Runway End Safety Area) reserve a
clear, gently-graded band on each side of a surface and a graded area
off each runway end.  A hill that rises into that band — into the
wingtip envelope alongside, or into the approach off the end — must be
graded DOWN so it transitions smoothly to the pavement edge.

This module samples the DEM along each surface edge/centerline and
emits grading polygons.  The LATERAL strips are FLAT shadows of the
surface they protect: at each station the strip sits at the local
pavement-edge altitude and extends out level, so it follows the
surface's longitudinal profile like an extension of the pavement.
Terrain is cut down to that surface level ONLY where the DEM rises
above it within the protected (code-letter wingtip) width; terrain at
or below the surface is left alone (the wingtip clears it).  Because
the cut floor IS the surface level, a lateral strip can never push
terrain below the pavement it protects — so a pavement that sits below
its surroundings (cut into a hillside, or sunk by the elevation solver)
no longer carves a canyon.

The runway-end RESA is the exception: it RAMPS from the runway-end
elevation at a gentle slope and daylights where it meets the DEM, so an
over-run/undershoot meets a slope rather than a wall.

Four passes share one strip builder:
  * taxiway lateral strips   (ROLE_TAXIWAY_CLEARANCE) — flat shadow,
    traced from the apt.dat taxi centerline network (+ enclosed-pocket
    perimeters, Pass A2)
  * airside ring-edge sweep  (Pass A3) — flat shadow off every
    TERRAIN-FACING pavement ring edge (junctions, aprons, per-node
    runway pieces, service roads) at the local rendered edge altitude
  * runway lateral strips    (ROLE_RUNWAY_CLEARANCE)  — flat shadow
  * runway-end RESA areas     (ROLE_RUNWAY_CLEARANCE)  — ramp

#   * the Pass-A3 airside ring-edge sweep does NOT run off APRON,

#     not a taxiway or runway); and
#   * the Pass-A centerline trace skips SERVICE centerlines.
# Groundside/building never sourced clearance and keep their 1 m standoff
# for what remains (see static_union).
#
# DEFAULT OFF — this gate does NOT ship on yet.  A 2026-07-10 A/B at CYXY
# (this worktree) shows that turning it ON REGRESSES the build: removing
# the apron/service clearance UNCOVERS steep terminal terrain, which the
# adjacent-ground band-march then backfills with clip-seam artifacts —
# adjacent-ground TEARS 0 → 10 (worst 8.98 m over 0.66 m), one NEW
# apron~graded_strip near-parallel lens, coincident nodes 3 → 70.  That
# is the SAME legacy-off flip blocker STATUS records (just smaller), and
# it fails the charter's own acceptance gates (tears stay 0; zero new
# near-parallel).  The apron/service pieces are, for now, HOLDING terrain
# the adjacent-ground law cannot yet grade cleanly.
#
# NOTE (fresh provenance trace — overturns the handover hypothesis): the
# large terminal blobs Noah flagged (CYXY site-1 notch, hangar) are NOT
# apron-sourced.  They are dominated by JUNCTION ring sweeps (site-1 =
# one 28,215 m² junction sweep) plus RESA and centerline strips; apron
# edges were a minor contributor.  Dissolving the blobs therefore needs
# the JUNCTION sweep gone too, which trips the FULL flip regression
# (nodes +~1,900, coincident →~260).  Both the apron/service scope-shrink
# AND the junction/RESA blob shrink are SLICE-B acceptance criteria
# (adjacent-ground clip-seam coordination / solver absorption), not a
# fix-now (pre-slice-B policy, Noah ruling 4).
#
# The gate exists so slice-B can A/B against the charter target.  It is
# scope FILTERING at source-edge collection — no code path is deleted;
# O4_CLEARANCE_CHARTER=1 enables the (currently regressing) filter.
# The ONE B4 review switch (config.B4_FLIP_DEFAULTS) flips this default ON
# under the flip bundle; an explicit O4_CLEARANCE_CHARTER always wins.

    Two regimes share this code:

        surface following its longitudinal profile (each station carries

        where it rises above it; the strip daylights where the DEM drops
        back to the surface.  Never produces a sub-surface floor, so it
        can't carve a canyon beside a pavement that sits below grade.
      * ``slope > 0`` (RESA end-caps) — the ceiling is a gentle ramp, so
        an over-run meets a slope rather than a wall.

    Terrain above the ceiling is cut down to it, and the cut DAYLIGHTS
    where the ceiling meets the DEM — so the graded patch is only as wide
    as it needs to be, capped at ``band_caps[i]`` (the code-letter
    wingtip width minus the pavement half-width).  Cut-only: a station
    contributes a strip ONLY where the terrain rises more than
    ``trigger`` m above the ceiling; flat or falling terrain is left
    untouched.

    ``edge_stations`` / ``edge_alts`` / ``outwards`` / ``band_caps`` are
    matched per-station lists (so the edge may curve, e.g. a centerline).

    an unnecessary cut ramp — so every skirt vertex lifts to the higher
    of the analytic floor and the DEM.  A vertex at/above the floor that
    descends no lower than the floor profile is lawful; the down-grade
    caps bound how far BELOW the floor is reachable, not how the surface
    rides an existing bump back up.  Shared verbatim by the emitter's

    """Fill-direction twin of ``_build_graded_strips``: at each station a
    FLOOR descends from the pavement-end altitude,

        floor(d) = edge_alt − floor_depth(d)

    (``floor_depth`` is the law's lowest-lawful-surface profile,
    ``grade_law.runway_end_skirt_floor_profile``, as a per-distance
    callable).  Terrain BELOW the floor is filled up to it, and the fill
    DAYLIGHTS where the floor meets the DEM — so the skirt is only as
    long as it needs to be, capped at ``band_caps[i]`` (the governed
    length; beyond it a drop is lawful).  Fill-only: a station
    contributes ONLY where the terrain falls more than ``trigger`` m
    below the floor; flat or rising terrain is left untouched (that is
    the cut passes' domain).

    Unlike the cut twin (whose linear ceiling a two-row ring renders
    exactly), the floor is CURVED (piecewise quadratic), and a
    ``node_altitudes`` polygon renders as a ruled surface between its
    rows — a single inner/outer ring would sag metres below the law
    floor mid-span.  So the skirt is emitted as ABUTTING BANDS split at
    ``band_edges`` (the law's own grade breakpoints,
    ``grade_law.runway_end_skirt_profile_breakpoints``): within a band
    the floor is one quadratic, bounding the chord sagitta at
    ``rate·L²/8`` (≤ 0.31 m) — far inside the fill trigger.  Adjacent
    bands share their boundary row vertices (same positions, same
    rounded altitudes), so they render as one continuous surface.

    Returns ``(ring_open, alts_open)`` pairs, one per (band × station
    run); the first band's inner edge sits a small gap outside the
    pavement at the floor's start altitude, each band's outer edge at
    the band boundary — or earlier, at the daylight point on the floor
    (= DEM there), so the fill meets natural ground with no step.

    ``weld_predicate`` (optional, ``(x, y) -> bool``) thins the
    innermost band's inner weld row (``d0 == 0``): between its run
    endpoints only the weld TRANSITIONS survive — the row's value
    profile is piecewise-linear with breakpoints only at run ends and
    the points where the predicate FLIPS, so the mesh lerp reproduces
    the dropped interior stations exactly (mirror of the adjacent-ground
    diet, ``adjacent_ground._build_fill_bands``).  When ``None`` the row
    keeps full density (unchanged behaviour).  Deeper bands (``d0 > 0``)
    and every outer row always keep full density.

    A grading shape must never MINT a node on a pavement edge (user
    ruling 2026-07-09): wherever the inner row touches pavement its
    vertices must be EXISTING pavement ring vertices.  So at each weld
    transition, instead of keeping the two bracketing stations, the row
    takes the single EXACT pavement ring vertex nearest the flip
    (``pav_vertex_at(x, y) -> (x, y) | None``, within one station
    spacing); run endpoints that lie ON pavement are snapped the same
    way, endpoints OFF pavement (the ±half ref-floor stretch) stay as
    station points.  If the exact-vertex lookup fails for a transition
    (no pavement vertex within one station spacing) the row falls back
    to keeping the two bracketing stations and the miss is reported.

    The exact mirror of the Pass C RESA cut: where Pass C cuts terrain
    that RISES above the 5 % up-ramp, the skirt fills terrain that DROPS
    away beyond the end, so a runway ending at a hillside brow meets a
    lawful ≤3 %/≤5 % descent instead of a cliff at the pavement edge
    (FAA AC 150/5300-13B §3.16.5 / ICAO Annex 14 §4.7 — the law lives in
    ``grade_law``; plan: docs/runway_end_skirt_plan.md).

    Called SEPARATELY from (and AFTER) ``emit_surface_clearance_cuts``,
    once ``final_grade_projection`` has settled the pavement profile:
    the skirt bakes the law floor from the pavement-end elevation and
    entry grade, and the final projection may move pad/junction
    altitudes at a blast-pad end AFTER the cuts are emitted (KCLT 18L
    rose 0.4 m, leaving an emit-time skirt too short under the settled
    floor).  Emitting here also means the static clip below sees every
    earlier shape — cuts, boundary ribbon, groundside, tunnels.

    The skirt is emitted as ABUTTING BANDS split at the law's grade
    breakpoints: the floor is piecewise quadratic and a two-row
    ``node_altitudes`` ring renders as a ruled chord that would sag
    metres below it mid-span; per-band the sagitta is ≤ rate·L²/8
    (≈ 0.31 m).  Bands are clipped against the static geometry and
    previously-emitted skirt pieces (crossing-runway ends; first wins),
    with per-vertex altitudes recomputed ANALYTICALLY from the outward
    projection so clipping can introduce vertices freely.

    # footprint overlaps is trimmed AROUND the skirt.  ``emitted_fill`` is

    # guarantee), so the trimmed groundside welds to the skirt chain with
    # zero minted near-parallel geometry and no unowned DEM sliver.  The
    # trimmed vertices' altitudes are re-derived through the same
    # ``_resample_node_altitudes_nn`` edge-interpolation path every other
    # groundside clip uses (tile_cut, boundary), so the remnant keeps
    # groundside's own DEM-following field.
