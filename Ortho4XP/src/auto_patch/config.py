#      (``ADJACENT_GROUND_ZONE_STATIC_KEEPOUT_M``, adjacent_ground

#   2. legacy deletion ⇒ CYXY 4 junction spine violations (worst 11 %):
#      band clip vertices ON a foreign pavement edge took zone-row values
#      instead of that pavement's solved edge value, and the final weld
#      stamped them into the junction rings — sites the legacy clearance

# field ceiling 727 → route-override 712, ~6 m below the DEM rim → G band-pinned

# per-edge cap (`TaxiRouteGraph.edge_cap`, the same 3 % data `_runway_reach_bands`
# uses under TAXI_REACH_BAND_BY_WIDTH), so a narrow route's ceiling rises to its

# feasible level ``clamp(DEM, lo, hi)``, **LIFT-ONLY** (never lower; never above
# the ceiling).  With the per-letter bands now correct (P3a recovers the unnamed
# arms' 3 %; P3 the field route-band), this lifts the bowled airside — buildings
# to their reachable-DEM (min(DEM, ceiling)), aprons/junctions with them — so the
# held corridor's neighbours rise WITH it and the within-shape steps close.  The
# subsequent projection (held corridor + hard anchors immovable) drives the lifted

# toward the LOW corridor (the apron-plane pass is lift-only-toward-taxi), so the

# corridor to its raw route-CEILING instead explodes within-shape (89) because the

# held junctions).  THE MISSING PIECE: the BUILDING must be the DRIVER — band via

# uses), placed at min(DEM, that band), with the apron conforming UP to the
# *building* (not the corridor) and the corridor→apron transition taken by the
