"""Spine crown v2 — lateral drainage built INTO the solve (part 30).

USER RULING 2026-07-07: everything with a spine — runways, taxiways,
service roads — crowns for drainage: the spine stays at the solved /
FAA-profile level and the EDGES sit LOWER by ``rate × lateral distance``
(capped at the corridor half-width).  Rates: ``config.py``
(RUNWAY/TAXI/SERVICE_ROAD_CROWN_TRANSVERSE, cited in docs/STANDARDS.md
"Transverse grades").

v1 (part 29b) applied the crown POST-solve as an edge-drop pass and
needed freeze sets, zero-drop vetoes, all-pairs smoothing and a revoke
valve to fight the already-projected surface — and still had to exclude
runways (crowned corners broke the runway_join spine check).  v2 puts
the crown INSIDE the construction:

* RUNWAYS: ``runway_redistribute._apply_profile_to_shapes`` stamps every
  ring vertex at ``profile(station) − RUNWAY_CROWN_TRANSVERSE ×
  half_width`` (the ring is the pavement EDGE; the persisted profile
  stays the centerline authority).  Every downstream reader — solver
  hard seeds, runway_join anchors, the flex hook, skirts — samples the
  same crowned shape values, so nothing disagrees by construction.
  Seam-bucket vertices are exempt (tile-seam pins are cross-tile terrain
  contracts).

* TAXI / SERVICE corridors: a per-node CROWN DROP FIELD ``c`` (this
  module) — ``c = rate × min(lateral, half_width)`` against the nearest
  same-family centerline, 0 for any node owned by a non-crowned shape,
  a seam pin, or a solver anchor.  The route-profile solve runs in
  UNCROWNED space ``z' = z + c`` (byte-identical to today's solve), and
  the writeback emits ``z = z' − c``: because the field is single-valued
  per canonical node, every weld stays consistent, and because the LAW
  reads the pair offset ``o_ab = c_b − c_a`` (``grade_law.
  crown_pair_offset``), the emitted surface satisfies
  ``|Δz − o_ab| ≤ budget`` exactly wherever the uncrowned solve
  satisfied ``|Δz'| ≤ budget`` — the solver and the validator share the
  one field (exported per node via the axes sidecar ``crown_drops``).

* EMISSION: the spine ridge is an OPEN way with per-node ``alt_abs``
  (``layout.crown_spines`` → ``to_osm`` → ``include_patches`` inserts it
  as constrained DUMMY breakline edges).  Taxi/service spines sample the
  SOLVED route profiles; runway spines sample the crowned pieces + their
  stamped drop (= the profile), so the breakline always agrees with the
  emitted pavement.

# premise measured FALSE: HECA's rails carry 30 / 10 / 18 crown on/off
# transitions (05C/23C, 05L/23R, 05R/23L).  A rail vertex co-owned by a
# non-crown shape (an apron or junction welded to the runway edge) is a hard
# ``c = 0`` contract, and its crowned rail neighbour carries the full
# ``RUNWAY_CROWN_TRANSVERSE × half_width`` drop — so the EMITTED rail steps by
# the whole crown over one ring edge, ON TOP of the profile's own longitudinal
# grade.  Measured at HECA: 2.45 % (05C/23C, 30.6 m), 2.27 % (05L/23R, 37.1 m),
# 2.17 % (05R/23L, 14.8 m) — all compliant at ~0.4-1.5 % in UNCROWNED space,

# frontier points, but at the FULL ``RUNWAY_MAX_GRADE``: it therefore spends
# the entire longitudinal budget on the crown and leaves none for the profile,
# which at HECA runs at 1.44-1.47 % right there.  This pass makes the drop
# assignment CONTINUOUS ALONG THE RAILS in the sense the emitted surface
# needs: over every runway ring EDGE the crown may change by at most the
# longitudinal budget MINUS the profile's own change across that edge
# (``|Δc| ≤ RUNWAY_MAX_GRADE·d − |ΔP|``), so
# ``|Δz_emit| = |ΔP − Δc| ≤ RUNWAY_MAX_GRADE·d`` by construction.
# Relaxation is monotone DOWNWARD (a drop is only ever lowered, never
# invented), so it converges and can never raise a node above its designed

    """Compute the per-node crown drop ``c`` (metres, > 0).  Returns
    ``{node_idx: drop}`` (the writeback transform set) and persists:

    * ``layout._crown_drop_key``  — canonical (x, y) key → drop (consumed by
      ``final_grade_projection``'s transform and the in-memory validators);
    * ``layout._crown_drop_ll``   — ``[(lat, lon, drop), …]`` (the axes
      sidecar export the OSM validator maps to nids).

    Field law (single source, both readers), first match wins per node:

    * FROZEN (c = 0): any owner is a non-crown shape (apron / terminal /
      building / boundary / groundside / adopted / degenerate), the node
      is a tile-seam bucket, or it is a solver value contract passed in
      ``freeze_idx`` (seam pins, building seats, groundside mouth welds,
      seam spine anchors).
    * RUNWAY-owned (incl. runway_crossing): the UNIFORM per-ref drop
      ``profiles[ref]['crown_drop_m']`` (crossings: min over member
      refs; shared keys: min over owning refs — uniformity keeps the
      reconstructed longitudinal profile untouched), axially TAPERED at
      ``TAXI_CROWN_TRANSVERSE`` toward any seam-bucket vertex so the
      crown eases into the uncrowned seam pieces instead of stepping.
    * TAXI / SERVICE corridor: ``rate_family × min(lateral to the
      nearest same-family centerline, half_width_family)``, 0 on the
      spine itself (≤ the spine tolerance); MIN over owning families.

    FAMILY SCOPING (part 30c): ``CROWN_RUNWAYS`` / ``CROWN_TAXI`` /
    ``CROWN_SERVICE`` gate which families contribute.  A de-scoped family's
    nodes are simply not crowned (c = 0, held via the frozen-key set) — the
    code path stays intact, it just registers no drop.  Default this
    iteration = runways only.

    RUNWAY-CROSSING BLEND (part 30c): a runway node inside a crossing's
    influence zone takes the drainage-dome drop (``_crossing_dome_drop``)
    instead of the uniform per-ref value — 0 on both centerlines, tapering to
    the min member half-width in the quadrants — so the two ridges cross at
    profile level and the edges blend smoothly.

    RUNWAY-JOIN ANCHORED nodes (``join_anchor_samples``, user ruling
    2026-07-16: taxi joins anchor to the RUNWAY EDGE value — the crowned
    edge — never the centerline/crown profile): ``{node_idx: (sample_x,
    sample_y, runway_shape)}`` from ``grade_graph.UnifiedGraph.
    runway_anchor_sample``.  Such a node carries the anchored runway
    value (uncrowned space) through the solve, so its writeback drop is
    what places the emitted join AT the crowned edge.  The drop is
    VALUE-DERIVED (the extend_field_to_new_ring_nodes model): the
    anchor shape's EMITTED edge is re-sampled at the exact anchor sample
    point — per ring vertex ``solved value − field drop``, the same
    interpolation the anchor value itself came from — and the join drop
    is ``anchor value − emitted edge``, so the join lands on the edge in
    EVERY regime (uniform drop, crossing dome blend, seam taper, flexed
    or crossing-reconciled ring values; a per-ref re-derivation measured
    0.15-0.23 m wrong where the anchor sampled a threshold-band or
    slab-deviated ring at KBNA 31).  The assignment is AUTHORITATIVE:
    it overrides any earlier freeze / shadow / family verdict for the
    node, and the rect equalize below leaves it alone (KBNA 13/31:
    joins that missed the drop — shadow gaps, rect-equalize pops,
    frozen co-owners — emitted 0.24-0.31 m proud of the crowned edge).

# ── interior segment cross-edge crown (Phase 0 hotfix, 2026-07-07) ───────────
#
# THE DEFECT: a crowned runway emits as many abutting sub-rects (profile-
# sampling segments).  Every INTERIOR cross-edge between two sub-rects is a
# constrained mesh edge whose ONLY nodes are the two corner vertices — which
# both carry the FULL crown drop (profile − rate·half_width).  The edge
# therefore constrains the mesh FLAT ACROSS at the dropped altitude, while the
# surface between segments carries the centerline ridge (the crown_spine
# breakline at profile level).  Result: a visible centre DIP at every segment
# line on every crowned runway (user: "airports unusable as is").
#
# THE HOTFIX (de-seg plan Phase 0 — does NOT de-segment): insert a CENTERLINE
# node on every interior cross-edge at the runway PROFILE altitude (crown drop
# 0 on the axis), into the rings of BOTH abutting sub-rects at the IDENTICAL
# canonical point so the emit-time consensus welds them into one node (a
# one-sided insert would mint a T-vertex/tear).  Each cross-section then reads
# as a tent (corner-low → centre-high → corner-low) matching the crown instead
# of a flat chord.  The centre altitude comes from the SAME persisted profile
# the crown_spine breakline uses, so the two constraints agree (no near-
# coincident duplicate constraint — the wedge class).
#
# Placement: the ABSOLUTE LAST geometry touch (with the probe-node hook, after
# decimation / final projection / skirts).  Like a probe node, a mid-edge
# vertex is exactly the 3D-collinear class emit decimation removes, so it must
# arrive after everything.  End edges (thresholds) are NOT interior (they belong
# to a single sub-rect, so they are never shared and are skipped by
# construction); skirts / RESA read the ends.  Seam-band edges are skipped
# (tile-seam pins are cross-tile terrain contracts — never inserted on/near).

# Reuse tile_cut's seam-line tolerance so a cross-edge in the seam band is left
# alone (its corners are pinned to the immutable seam DEM).

    Mechanism:

    * Group ``ROLE_RUNWAY`` sub-rects by ref.  Map each ring edge to its
      canonical endpoint-key pair.  An edge shared by exactly two sub-rects
      of the same ref is an interior cross-edge (long edges and end/threshold
      edges belong to a single sub-rect, so they are never shared).
    * The cross-edge midpoint lies on the runway axis (both corners are at the
      same station, ± half-width), so it IS the centerline point at that
      station.  Its altitude is the persisted profile evaluated at the
      station — identical to the source the crown_spine breakline samples, so
      the new node sits exactly on the ridge.
    * Insert the node into both rings at the midpoint (identical XY → the
      emit consensus welds them) with drop 0 (on the axis), lifting the
      cross-section into a crown-matching tent.
