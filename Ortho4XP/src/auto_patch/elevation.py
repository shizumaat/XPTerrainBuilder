"""Pavement elevation: anchors → graph → solver → grade clamp.

Phase-2 elevation work: layer altitudes onto the role-classified
shape topology produced by Phase-1.  Pipeline:

* DEM tile loading + sampling for terrain-derived elevations.
* CIFP threshold anchors for runway profile.
* Apron-side multi-source-Dijkstra grade cone (FAA apron cap).
* Unified Laplacian Jacobi solver over the per-shape elevation
  graph.
* Per-shape grade clamp (taxiway / apron / runway).
* Junction triangulation + free-vertex clamp for the residue
  polygons.
* Sliver-junction merge + violating-junction subdivision.
* Geometric finalization (overlap clip against fixed shapes,
  shared-vertex altitude reconciliation, terminal apron
  re-derivation).

This module is large because the network ↔ solver ↔ grade triple
is tightly coupled — splitting it produces leaky abstractions.
The plan envelope (~900 lines) was optimistic; current size sits
near 3,700 lines.  Future iteration may split into ``_Solver``
and ``_Grade`` siblings if either half can be cleanly separated.

    """Given a new polygon (post geometry edit) and the OLD ring's
    open-form coords + closed-form altitudes, return a fresh
    ``node_altitudes`` list (closed) for ``new_poly``.

    For each new vertex, sample its altitude via:
      1. **Edge interpolation (preferred).**  Find the OLD edge that
         contains the new vertex (perpendicular distance ≤
         ``EDGE_TOL_M``).  Compute the parametric position ``t`` along
         that edge and linearly interpolate between the edge's two
         endpoint altitudes.  This is the correct sampling for
         vertices inserted by ``polygon.difference`` / ``buffer(0)``
         / boundary clip — they sit exactly on old edges by shapely's
         geometric guarantee, so the edge's linear gradient is the
         authoritative source.
      2. **Nearest-neighbour (fallback).**  When no old edge contains
         the new vertex (rare; happens for vertices inserted in the
         polygon interior or after a degenerate buffer(0) repair),
         fall back to NN against old-ring vertices.

    Per user 2026-05-13: pure NN historically produced jumpy
    altitude deltas at cut-edge vertices — two adjacent new vertices
    on the same old edge could pick *different* old endpoints as
    their nearest, fabricating a step that didn't exist in the
    pre-cut shape's smooth altitude field.  Edge interpolation
    preserves the original gradient.

    ``interior_edge_project`` (default ``False``) upgrades the pass-2
    fallback: instead of snapping a genuinely-interior new vertex to
    the nearest old *vertex* altitude, it projects the vertex onto the
    nearest old *edge* (perpendicular distance unbounded) and
    interpolates along that edge's endpoint altitudes.  Pure vertex-NN
    quantises an interior cut vertex to one ring corner, which on a
    sloped piece can be off by ``gradient x (distance to nearest
    corner)`` — metre-scale on a strongly-sloped, sparse-ring piece
    (see the tunnel graze-clip reproducer).  Edge projection recovers
    the boundary gradient value.  Off by default so every existing
    caller (boundary ribbon, tile-cut, sliver merge, …) stays
    byte-identical; only the tunnel graze-clip node_altitudes path
    opts in, where the interior vertices are buffered-gate cut points
    inside a possibly-sloped ramp/wall piece.

    Used wherever a polygon edit (boundary clip, buffer(0) repair,
    push-off, sliver merge, tile-cut, etc.) changes the vertex
    count and we would otherwise have to drop ``node_altitudes``.

    Per user 2026-04-28: replaces the bottom-up DEM-driven
    pipeline (centerline graph + apron-pin + post-pin
    reconciliation + within-junction smoother) with a single
    top-down propagation:

      1. Hard anchors = every CIFP-derived RUNWAY corner (every
         segment in the runway chain has its altitude_high /
         altitude_low set from the FAA-compliant profile, and
         every corner of every segment counts as HARD).
      2. Build the unified pavement graph: every shape's polygon
         ring vertex becomes a node; ring edges + cross-shape
         shared-bucket edges connect them.
      3. Constrained Laplacian solve via Jacobi iteration with
         per-edge grade-cap projection:
           - Each iteration: every non-anchor node moves to the
             length-weighted average of its neighbours, then each
             edge with |Δelev|/length > max_grade pulls its
             endpoints toward each other (or moves the soft one
             toward the anchored one).
           - Per-shape role-specific grade caps (all 1.5 %; user
             2026-05-18 aligned the apron cap with the taxi cap):
               runway/runway: 1.5 % (already enforced by HARD)
               taxi rect / junction / apron / terminal: 1.5 %
               cross-shape: min of the two roles.
           - Terminal corners constrained to be FLAT (all corners
             of one terminal share a single value at every
             iteration).
      4. After convergence, apply the solved elevations back to
         every shape:
           - ROLE_RUNWAY: skip (HARD, already correct).
           - ROLE_PRIMARY_PARALLEL / SECONDARY_PARALLEL / STUB /
             CROSS_CONNECTOR: derive altitude_high/low from the
             rect's 4 corners (avg of corners 0,3 / corners 1,2).
           - ROLE_BUILDING: avg of all corners → altitude.
           - ROLE_JUNCTION: per-vertex node_altitudes from corner
             elevations.

    The architectural advantage: every step of the previous
    pipeline solves a different subset of the constraints, and
    they sometimes disagree (which is why we kept finding new
    edge cases).  This single solve handles all constraints
    simultaneously.

    Performance: O((V + E) × I) where I = iteration count.
    Typically I ≈ graph_diameter² × log(1/tol) — for CYXY
    (~30-hop diameter) ≈ 900 iterations; for HECA (~150-hop)
    ≈ 22 500.  Each iteration is a single sweep of the edge
    list, ~1 µs/edge; CYXY ≈ 0.5 s, HECA ≈ 5 s.  Compare to the
    old pipeline at ~3.5 s and ~30 s respectively.

    When a pair exceeds ``max_grade`` (default 1.5 %, matching the
    FAA taxiway cap), nudge the un-anchored vertex(es) toward the
    grade band.

    Per user 2026-04-28: corner alignment between junctions and
    sloping rects is already enforced by
    ``_snap_junction_altitudes_to_rect_corners`` and
    ``_enforce_shared_vertex_altitudes``, but interior junction
    vertices can still disagree with their immediate neighbours by
    > 1.5 % over short distances (1217 such pairs at CYXY, worst
    17.6 %).  These come from the multi-source apron pin step
    (DEM plane-fit ↔ taxi-graph ↔ apron-pin DEM-clipped-to-ring-
    grade) where adjacent vertices pull from different sources.
    Iterating an adjacent-pair smoother after all the bucket-
    averaging passes have converged the SHARED-vertex constraints
    is the cleanest way to flatten the remaining within-polygon
    grade humps.

    Vertex anchoring rules:
      * A vertex is HARD if its bucket coincides with a sloping
        rect corner (runway / primary_parallel / secondary_parallel
        / stub / cross_connector) — its altitude must equal the
        rect's tag value and CANNOT be modified.
      * Otherwise the vertex is SOFT and may move.

    Pair handling:
      * Both HARD ⇒ skip (constraint unsolvable here).
      * One HARD, one SOFT ⇒ move the soft one to the boundary
        of the hard one's grade band.
      * Both SOFT ⇒ average (preserves volume).

    Returns the number of altitude entries adjusted (cumulative
    across iterations).

    self-referential to the old terminal altitude).

    Per user 2026-04-28: at CYXY the terminal's DEM-median was
    700.8 m, but the apron actually borders runway 02 (694 m) on
    the south and taxiway F (~692 m) on the north.  The terminal
    sits on naturally elevated ground that the apron pavement
    doesn't reach.  Forcing terminal to its DEM altitude forced
    the apron-pin step to bridge a 7 m gap over short distances,
    producing 4-7 % grade violations.

    Sampling only HARD-anchored sloping rect corners (whose
    elevations come from CIFP runway thresholds + chained
    grade-compliant interpolation, NOT from the terminal) breaks
    the self-reference.  The median of those anchors gives a
    terminal altitude consistent with the apron's actual
    elevation range — the apron's grade then flattens naturally
    because all four boundary classes (terminal, runway, taxi,
    junction) end up within a few metres of each other.

    the surface at the dropped-segment's footprint can sit 4-5 m
    above the runway's CIFP profile.  Reading along the runway,
    the rendered surface dips into the runway segment, rises
    over the apron-junction-covered void, then dips back into
    the next segment — the user's "ridge across runway".

    Re-emitting the dropped segment with its preserved
    ``altitude``/``altitude_high``/``altitude_low`` puts a real
    runway-altitude plate back into the output.  The
    surrounding apron junction is clipped (subtracted) so it no
    longer covers the runway footprint.  The runway surface is
    now continuous at its profile altitude through the absorbed
    area.

    Returns the number of segments re-emitted.

# elevations) to those anchor values, initialize free cells to DEM
# clipped into the local feasibility cone (anchor ± dist × 1.5 %),

    S/T/W/J/R cluster).  The final solver re-derives node_altitudes for
    the clipped pieces, so this is a pure geometry pass.

    Walks every shape and, where it overlaps another shape, modifies
    or drops it so no two shapes overlap.  Order of priority (the
    LATER a role appears in this list, the more it "yields"):

    1. RUNWAY corners (CIFP-anchored, immutable footprint).
    2. TAXI rect (one per OSM centerline; rect dedup ran upstream).
    3. TERMINAL pad (OSM building).
    4. JUNCTION (residue — must clip to fit around all of the above).

    Strategy:

    * Drop duplicate TERMINAL polygons (a terminal entirely inside
      another terminal is a duplicate from OSM relation parsing).
    * Drop duplicate or heavily-overlapping RUNWAY segments
      (apron-merged runway segmentation can produce overlap with
      the original single-rect runway).
    * Clip each JUNCTION against every fixed shape (rect / runway /
      terminal) and against larger junctions.  Iterate up to 4
      passes so chained clips converge.
