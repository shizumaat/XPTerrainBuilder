"""Per-building route-feasibility elevation (user model, 2026-06-22).

A building that touches airside pavement is seated FLAT at the elevation
closest to its DEM that keeps it reachable WITHIN GRADE from EVERY runway
threshold along the real taxi route — the "heaviest anchor" the rest of the
network then grades to (docs/taxi_centerline_grading_plan.md §9).

The route to a building (user's definition, validated on CYXY):

  1. a PERPENDICULAR from the building centroid to the NEAREST taxi
     centerline (named or not — geometry only).  The part of that
     perpendicular inside the taxiway-width corridor climbs at the
     taxiway's own cap; the part beyond (real apron) at the apron cap (1%).
  2. from the foot point, the taxi-route to each threshold along the
     centerline graph at the PER-EDGE per-letter caps (narrow A/B = 3 %,
     wide C–F = 1.5 %) — including the partial first edge from the foot
     point to its graph node (the bit that snapping to the node would drop).

The feasibility BAND is the intersection over ALL thresholds:

  ceiling = min_t ( thr_elev_t + climb_t )
  floor   = max_t ( thr_elev_t − climb_t )

and the seated level is ``clamp(DEM, floor, ceiling)`` — closest to DEM,
could be above or below it.  Buildings NOT touching airside pavement are
omitted (the caller leaves them at their DEM).

A narrow code-A/B arm contributes its 3 % cap.  The ICAO size travels
PER-SEGMENT on each ``apt_dat_reader.TaxiCenterline`` (``seg_sizes``), so the
per-letter cap at the foot is read off the geometry — no name→letter table.
