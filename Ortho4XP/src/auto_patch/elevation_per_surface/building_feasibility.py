"""Per-building route-feasibility elevation (user model, 2026-06-22).

A building that touches airside pavement is seated FLAT at the elevation
closest to its DEM that keeps it reachable WITHIN GRADE from EVERY runway
threshold along the real taxi route — the "heaviest anchor" the rest of the
network then grades to (docs/taxi_centerline_grading_plan.md §9).

The route to a building (user's definition, validated on CYXY):

  1. a PERPENDICULAR from the building centroid to the NEAREST taxi
     centerline (named or not — geometry only).  The part of that
     perpendicular inside the taxiway-width corridor climbs at the
     taxiway's own cap; the part beyond (real apron) at the apron cap (1%).
  2. from the foot point, the taxi-route to each threshold along the
     centerline graph at the PER-EDGE per-letter caps (narrow A/B = 3 %,
     wide C–F = 1.5 %) — including the partial first edge from the foot
     point to its graph node (the bit that snapping to the node would drop).

The feasibility BAND is the intersection over ALL thresholds:

  ceiling = min_t ( thr_elev_t + climb_t )
  floor   = max_t ( thr_elev_t − climb_t )

and the seated level is ``clamp(DEM, floor, ceiling)`` — closest to DEM,
could be above or below it.  Buildings NOT touching airside pavement are
omitted (the caller leaves them at their DEM).

A narrow code-A/B arm contributes its 3 % cap.  The ICAO size travels
PER-SEGMENT on each ``apt_dat_reader.TaxiCenterline`` (``seg_sizes``), so the
per-letter cap at the foot is read off the geometry — no name→letter table.

    a raster field, a per-query nearest-visible-centerline path serving the
    raster's ``None`` answers, and a ``_build_skeleton_band`` fallback with
    no service filter — and mixed them PER QUERY inside one building's ring.
    Two of them are gone; what remains is:

      * VALUE — :func:`spine_value_fields`: anchor values propagated along
        NON-SERVICE airside routes at the applicable caps, on the unified
        graph the spine solves and the validator checks.  A route metric.
      * LOOKUP — :func:`raster_reach_band.build_raster_reach_band`: a grid
        that answers "which route attachment serves this point, and what
        does the local off-route leg to it cost".  Grid/raster is a QUERY
        ACCELERATION only; it does not carry the metric (the audited bug it
        used to have: propagating VALUE through the paved grid is an AREA
        metric, and it under-credited 8.7 m on the U-fixture whenever a
        service route crossed apron pavement — biasing seats LOW, exactly

    STAYS: it gates the LAW (which edges reachability may ride), not the
    engine.  A point off the pavement mask beyond the bounded off-net
    radius reads ``None`` (the local within-shape law governs it) — there
    is no fallback path left to mix in.

    ``band.batch(nodes, limit)`` is the list form ``node_bands`` may
