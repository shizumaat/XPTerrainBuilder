"""Anchors + bounds for the one-profile solve — all from THE ONE graph.

There is a single reachability graph: the reach band computed on THE unified
grade graph (``building_feasibility.reach_band_unified``).  It sets the building
levels AND bounds every apron / spine / rect node, so they agree by
construction.  This module never builds a second graph.

* ``reach_band_for`` — build the band (+ a DEM sampler + the runway-edge anchors)
  once per solve.
* ``build_building_seats`` — seat each airside building FLAT at the level its
  FRONTAGE can reach (the band intersected over the pad ring), not the centroid:
  the band is a per-point envelope and a serving centerline climbs along a pad,
  so the centroid may reach higher than the apron around the pad can grade to.
* ``node_bands`` — the per-node ``(floor, ceiling)`` the solve clamps into.
* ``apron_body_nodes`` — apron-body vs taxi-route role split (target only).

# The queued fix for the "two NON-touching parallel service roads seat a
# metre-scale wall across the gap" defect (#576↔#584): widen the spine-station
# merge past its 2 m sliver window (the O4_SVC_PROXIMITY_COUPLE analogue, which
# misses a several-metre gap) so a near-parallel pair a few metres apart shares
# ONE DEM seed + ONE reach-band intersection — a single-valued cross-section the
# wall cannot be seeded on.  A TANGENT guard (|cos∠(tangent_a, tangent_b)| above
# the threshold — antiparallel loop returns count, a crossing road ≈90° never
# does) keeps it to genuine parallel pairs.
#
# SHIPPED OFF (measured 2026-07-08).  The documented #576↔#584 site no longer
# exists at HEAD (intervening commits — the off-source SOURCE CLIP and adjacent-
# ground work — reshaped HECA's service net; the equivalent HECA pair is now
# 0.19 m, resolved).  Where this coupling actually FIRES (CYXY -10045↔-10195,
# 6.7 m apart) the two roads differ by ~1.5 m for GENUINE terrain reasons
# (non-overlapping reach bands — the SAME physics part-30m recorded for
# #576↔#584: "each road on its OWN spine regime"); forcing a shared seed there
# REGRESSED CYXY (worst service tear 22.2→23.2 %, facing step 1.523→1.587 m).
# Proximity + parallelism alone cannot tell a "coincidental wall that should be
# flat" from "two roads terrain genuinely holds apart" — they are identical
# geometry — so no guard makes the coupling both effective and non-regressing.
# Kept behind the gate (idiomatic default-off experiment) for a future revisit
# that carries the missing signal (e.g. a shared groundside connection proving
# the pair SHOULD be co-level).  ``O4_SVC_PARALLEL_STATION_MERGE=1`` enables it;

    2026-06-28).

    A no-building apron has no pad to anchor it, so its feeder taxiways each grade
    to their own DEM-driven level and can arrive INCOMPATIBLE (the ``route_reach``
    violation: feeder contacts whose elevation gap exceeds the apron cap over their
    separation).  Rather than force the apron FLAT (one level for all feeders, which
    over-constrains and wastes the apron's own grade budget), anchor EACH feeder
    contact at the level feasible THERE — its reach band, biased to DEM — projected
    onto the apron-cap polytope so the apron TILTS ≤cap between contacts:

        minimise Σ(L_i − t_i)²  s.t.  |L_i − L_j| ≤ cap·d_ij  and  f_i ≤ L_i ≤ ce_i

    (:func:`_project_apron_contacts`).  ``t_i = clamp(DEM_i, band_i)`` pulls a feeder
    floating ABOVE its reach band back down to a reachable level; the projection
    then shares the apron's cap so close feeders need not be equal, only gradeable.
    A solution clears ``route_reach`` BY CONSTRUCTION (the constraints ARE its
    condition); an EMPTY polytope (a feeder's band can't reconcile with another's
    across the cap) is FUNDAMENTAL → skipped (documented transition, not a gate).

    Aprons that abut a building are skipped (the pad anchors the level).  The caller
    (``solve.py``) ANCHORS the returned ``{contact_node: L_i}`` like a building seat
    (heaviest), so the feeder SPINES grade to meet the apron (user 2026-06-28 — the
    apron must anchor for the spines to adjust to it; a SOFT ``node_band`` clamp let
    whatever pinned a feeder win and didn't converge).  Only the per-feeder CONTACTS
    are anchored — at their OWN reachable level — so the apron body still flexes and
    the feeder reaches L_i without an over-cap step (the earlier FLAT whole-ring seat
    forced unreachable levels → regressed ``cyxy_spine_zero`` + HECA runway).  Gate

    """``{apron_node_idx: floor_level}`` for soft-pavement edges that face a
    building pad across a NEAR-MISS gap — so the pavement grades UP to the flat
    pad instead of cliffing ~0.5–1 m below it across a thin unpaved sliver.

    THE DEFECT (SPJC pavement_grade step gate, 2026-07-08): building29's flat
    pad (seat 25.56) runs parallel to a large apron 0.68 m away at ~24.9 — a
    0.66 m visible step.  The 0.68 m source offset (DSF pad outline vs apt.dat
    apron edge) is just over ``SHARED_VERTEX_TOL_M`` (0.5 m), so no vertices
    are shared: the pre-solve weld and ``stitch_pavement_to_terminals`` never
    fire, the pad's frontage-seat recognition (exact 2-dp key match in
    ``build_building_seats``) never sees the edge, and
    ``build_nobuilding_apron_seats`` SKIPS the apron ("a building anchors the
    level" — within 1 m of a pad) even though the pad anchors nothing there.
    The apron falls through every regime and solves to its own low DEM.

    THE FIX is raise-biased and value-side only, and it is per-EDGE: the
    solve-time ring is SPARSE along a long frontage (SPJC's apron faces the
    90 m pad with one 49 m straight edge whose endpoints sit 1.5 m and 10 m
    away — no ring vertex lies inside any sub-metre radius; the near-pad OSM
    vertices are post-solve planarize/T-weld inserts that INTERPOLATE along
    that edge).  So the value-controlling nodes are the near-miss edge's
    ENDPOINTS.  For every soft-pavement ring edge whose segment passes within
    ``BUILDING_FRONTAGE_NEAR_MISS_M`` of a pad and whose endpoints are BOTH
    canonically unshared with the pad (a true near-miss run — an edge with a
    pad-shared endpoint is already reconciled by weld/stitch/seat identity
    and legitimately grades away from the seat), floor BOTH endpoints at
    ``seat − APRON_MAX_GRADE·d`` with ``d`` each endpoint's own distance to
    the pad (the building↔apron law: the level the pavement must reach to
    grade ≤cap up to the flat pad; the floor decays at the apron-law rate, so
    a far endpoint gets a proportionally lower floor and the interpolated
    near-pad run lands at ~seat), clamped to the endpoint's reach-band
    ceiling so it stays runway-reachable.  ORDERING: the pad seat is read from
    ``building_seats`` AS ALREADY CHOSEN by ``build_building_seats`` (seats +
    POCS coupling run first; ``solve.py`` calls this afterwards, before the
    no-building apron seats merge) — the near-miss edge must NEVER feed the
    pad's ``_frontage_box`` ceiling, so the pad seat cannot be pulled DOWN by
    the lower apron (which would just move the step to the pad's other,
    genuinely-shared frontage).  SOFT floors through the one ``spine_floor``
    channel (never hard seats): one raise-biased regime the solver resolves
    with its neighbour cap slabs — per-vertex hard anchors from a second
    regime are the documented unresolvable-tear pattern.  Feasibility is not
    at risk: floors are ≤ seat by construction (cap·d ≥ 0), decay at the
    apron-law rate, and are band-ceiling-clamped.

    BUILDING-ANCHORED apron's edge — so the feeder SPINE grades UP to the apron
    instead of the (senior) apron sagging down to the feeder's DEM-low mouth.

    The complement of :func:`build_nobuilding_apron_seats`, which handles ONLY
    no-building aprons (it bails on any apron within 1 m of a building).  A building
    apron is held high by its pad seat, but where the apron edge is FAR from the
    building (beyond ``BUILDING_REACH_CORRIDOR_M``, so the building-frontage spine
    floor never reaches it) a feeder taxiway contacting that edge falls through every
    floor rule and solves to its own low DEM — dragging the apron edge into a cliff
    (OEMA TX8 #275: apron #198 held at 639 by a building 310 m away, TX8 mouth at the
    DEM 629 → a 96 % within-apron step).  This was the documented authority inverted:
    "a taxiway/apron node is apron-owned; the taxi yields", not the reverse.

    The floor is the apron's OWN guaranteed-reachable level at the contact: the apron
    grades ≤ ``APRON_MAX_GRADE`` from each adjacent building seat, so at a contact
    ``d`` metres from a building seated at ``S`` the apron is at least ``S − cap·d``.
    Taking the max over the apron's buildings and clamping to the contact's reach band
    gives the level the feeder must rise to (never above the band ceiling, so it stays
    runway-reachable; never below the band floor).  A FLOOR (not a hard seat) so the
    feeder spine still grades smoothly up from its runway anchor and the apron body
    flexes — the taxi yields UP, the apron keeps its cap.  Gate
    ``O4_APRON_CONTACT_FLOOR=0`` disables (no floors, byte-identical).

    band is NEVER consumed by that law, yet computing it is the KBNA gate-ON
    scaling wall: a zone node sits OFF the pavement net, so ``band()`` takes
    the expensive skeleton-``_fallback`` path (~74 ms/node vs ~12 ms on-net),

def apply_groundside_reach(layout, bucket_to_idx, elev, cap):
    """Re-level each groundside piece a service road connects to an apron, to the
    elevation the connector can REACH within the service-road grade cap — so the
    connector grades <=cap instead of ramping steeply to the groundside's raw DEM
    (user 2026-06-27, refining the accept-the-ramp model).

    "After buildings and aprons are anchored, check groundside pieces: if they have
    a service road, and if that road reaches an apron, follow that route to find
    what elevation the groundside can reach within grade and anchor it there.  If it
    has no service roads they just stay DEM."

    The service road that meets a groundside piece may reach the apron through a
    CHAIN of service roads/junctions (an out-and-back route, a yard loop), so the
    binding reference is the connector's OWN apron-ward mouth elevation (already
    solved), not the distant apron: the groundside mouth can sit at most
    ``cap * route_len`` from it (``route_len`` = the binding apron-ward->groundside
    edge).  Whether to re-level at all is gated by APRON REACHABILITY — the piece's
    service road must connect (directly or through the service network) to an apron;
    a groundside-only yard road never re-levels its piece.

    The piece is shifted by a UNIFORM offset (preserving its DEM relief) so its
    mouth(s) sit at the closest-to-DEM reachable level; the connector then grades the
    short climb at <=cap.  A piece reached by several connectors must satisfy them
    ALL (interval INTERSECTION of the per-connector shift bounds).

    Mutates groundside ``node_altitudes`` in place and returns ``(n_relevelled,
    welds)`` where ``welds = {node_idx: shifted_groundside_alt}`` for the mouths of
    the APRON-REACHABLE connectors only (the caller pins ``elev`` to these so the
    connector and groundside emit as one welded node).  A service road that does NOT
    reach an apron is left untouched — its piece stays DEM and its mouth is not
    pinned (the user's "stays DEM" case).  Safe to shift a whole piece because a
    groundside lot shares no nodes with airside (a clearance gap separates them) —
    only the connector mouth, which is welded to the shifted level."""

    network's DEM-follow computed per spine STATION and shared by the whole
    cross-section, instead of per ring vertex.

    Per-vertex DEM-follow let a road's two long edges bind to DIFFERENT
    anchor regimes (each side clamps into the reach band of ITS nearest
    welds), which rendered a cross-road tear — CYXY 2.49 m at
    60.7092306,-135.0738928.  Here the ROAD HUGS TERRAIN LONGITUDINALLY
    within its cap along the spine, and every ring vertex of a cross-section
    takes the SAME station value, so a tear across the road cannot even be
    seeded.  These are SEEDS ONLY (soft): the road's within-shape law edges
    (``grade_graph.SOFT_VISIBILITY_ROLES`` + the service lateral pass, same
    gate) are the authority and the solve's final projections remain the
    sole writer.

    Mechanism, mirroring the per-vertex operator 1:1 but on stations:
      * stations = clusters of the service ring vertices' perpendicular
        projections onto the service (truck-route) centerlines — the spine
        arclength is the station coordinate, so opposite-edge partners
        (aligned by ``insert_service_lateral_nodes``) share one station;
      * station DEM = mean vertex DEM of the cluster, LOW-PASSED along the
        line (±~1.5 station steps) — the seed follows terrain at station
        wavelength, not raster noise (a lone unpaired station otherwise
        imprints its own DEM sample as a cross/diagonal step);
      * station band = the INTERSECTION of the member vertices' node-graph
        reach bands (``[max member floor, min member ceil]``) — the SAME
        cap-Lipschitz reach the per-vertex operator used, so connectivity
        to the mouth welds is inherited from the proven node graph (an
        earlier separate station-graph Dijkstra left whole chains
        anchor-unreachable), while the INTERSECTION makes both edges obey
        BOTH sides' anchors at once;
      * clamp + the SAME distance-weighted break blend as the per-vertex
        path (an empty intersection is exactly the old two-regime
        contradiction, now surfaced once per cross-section); broken
        stations quarantine their members through the existing
        ``service_break`` machinery.

    Returns ``(node_target, broken_nodes)``: seed values for the non-anchor
    vertices that found a station (vertices with no spine within reach — wide
    service-junction yards — keep the legacy per-vertex path), and the subset
    belonging to genuinely broken stations."""

    A ground-vehicle road is NOT airside: it rises/falls toward terrain, anchored
    only where it WELDS to the airside (taxi/apron/runway, kept at their solved
    bowl elevation) or to a groundside piece (``anchor_extra``).  Every other
    service node sits at ``clamp(DEM, reach-band-from-anchors-at-cap)`` where the
    reach band is the cap-Lipschitz envelope along the SERVICE graph (axial, edge by
    edge) — so a road ramps from its airside connection toward DEM at <=4% instead
    of being held flat in the bowl (SVC4 was ~6-11 m below terrain).  The
    road-vs-airside seam is by design (``check_grade._airside_groundside_pair``), so
    rising past a flat neighbour is not a step.

    SPINE-FIRST (config.SVC_SPINE_FIRST, default ON, part 30m): the DEM target
    is computed per spine STATION (shared by the whole cross-section) instead
    of per vertex — see ``_svc_spine_station_seeds``.  ``O4_SVC_SPINE_FIRST=0``
    restores the per-vertex behaviour below byte-identically.
