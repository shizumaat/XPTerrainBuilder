"""Whole-airport flat fast path (spec §3.3, Tier 2).

When an airport is provably flat, the route-profile solve's expensive
terrain-dependent stages — the reach bands (:func:`anchors.node_bands` and
the per-building band evaluation in ``building_feasibility``), the spine
profile, the body fill and the feasibility iteration — do no useful work:
every soft node is already feasible and already in grade at its DEM seed.
:func:`certify_flat_airport` proves this with a conservative certificate; when
it holds, :func:`apply_flat_airport_fast_path` seeds every soft node at its DEM
value, runs write-back and emission unchanged, and lets the scoped final grade
projection defer every certified shape.

A :class:`FlatAirportCertificate` HOLDS only when ALL of:

* every soft pavement shape's within-shape grade edges are satisfied at the
  DEM seed — reused from the Tier-0/1 flatness certificates
  (``lazy_certified`` markers on the constraint entries) for the certified
  shapes, and verified directly against the seed for any shape that was not
  certified (runway-adjacent junctions, service junctions);
* every airside-served (and every detached) building footprint's DEM relief
  fits the seat flatness tolerance — buildings are FLAT (owner ruling), so a
  flat footprint seats at its DEM mean by inspection (write-back averages the
  ring), and a non-flat footprint refuses the whole airport;
* every runway's along-axis DEM relief fits the runway profile budgets
  (``RUNWAY_END_GRADE`` in the end zones, ``RUNWAY_MAX_GRADE`` elsewhere) at
  ``FLATNESS_CERTIFICATE_RATE_FACTOR`` margin, sampled through the exact
  ``elevation._sample_dem`` discipline the node seeds use;
* no bridge / tunnel / crossing-terrain / object-pad / portal-crown subsystem
  claimed any geometry at this airport.

Any doubt refuses (fail toward correctness): a refused certificate simply
sends the airport down the normal solve.  Every refusal records a reason
string (``layout._flat_airport_fast_path_reason``) for the per-airport
``[flat-certificate]`` summary line.
