"""The ONE-PROFILE solve (user spec 2026-06-24; docs/one_profile_solve.md).

The single source of elevation truth for the airside network, and it uses ONE
graph: the reach band on the unified grade graph
(``building_feasibility.reach_band_unified``).
That band sets the building levels AND bounds every apron / spine / rect node, so
they agree by construction — there is no second reachability graph.

Every free node gets ``[floor_i, ceil_i]`` from ``node_band`` (the reach band at
the node) and is pulled to a per-role target, clamped into ``[floor_i, ceil_i] ∩
the neighbour cap slabs`` by a projected Gauss-Seidel pass:

* APRON BODY → closest-to-DEM within the band (it rises to the building it fronts
  through the shared frontage edge, a neighbour cap slab — no building floor
  anchor needed).
* taxi SPINE + RECT ends → smoothest (min curvature); the spine clamps ONLY to
  its centerline-consecutive neighbours (a 1-D feasible chain) so the apron
  yields to it.  A rect tilts as a plane (flat across width via the ``cap=0``
  cross edges + the final couple); it climbs because its band ceiling near a
  high building/terminal is high.

Buildings, runway contacts and tile seams are fixed anchors (buildings flat at
their FRONTAGE-reachable level — see ``anchors.build_building_seats``).

    the same ``c*`` as the original scan-from-0 over the union — without
    materialising the O(write-degree) ``forbidden`` union copy per edge that

    Precomputes one deterministic write-conflict coloring
    (:func:`_extend_edge_coloring_by_write`); each sweep relaxes the color
    classes in order, every class as a single vectorized fancy-indexed update
    whose writes are disjoint (a valid independent projection batch) and which
    reads the LATEST values from earlier classes — a true Gauss-Seidel step at
    numpy speed, converging where the degree-normalised Jacobi stalls.

    KKT / dual feasibility certificate (survey candidate 4): a full sweep that
    applies NO correction proves every constraint satisfied, so iteration stops
    on proof rather than the ``max_iters`` cap; the avoided sweeps are recorded
    in ``stats``.  ``stats`` (optional dict) receives ``colors``, ``edges``,
    ``sweeps``, ``sweeps_avoided``, ``certified`` and ``worst``.

    FEASIBILITY PRE-CHECK (perf 2026-07-18, byte-identical): one vectorized
    residual pass over the flat edge columns BEFORE the coloring.  Sweep 1
    applies zero corrections iff every edge is already within tolerance at
    entry (the first color class only moves when active, so an all-satisfied
    system passes through every class untouched) — so when no edge violates,
    this returns the exact certified-on-sweep-1 result (``(1, True)``, the
    same counters and writeback) without paying the coloring or the per-color
    array build at all.  The repeated re-projection call sites are usually
    already feasible, which is where the saving lands.  ``stats["colors"]`` is
    unknowable without coloring and reported as ``None`` on this path (it is
    only ever read by the ``O4_STEP_DEBUG`` print, under which the coloring IS
    computed so the line stays faithful).  ``run_feasibility_precheck=False``
    forces the full path (test hook; both paths are value-identical).

    ``coloring_state`` (optional dict, mutated) carries the incremental
    coloring across lazy-expansion rounds — see
    :func:`_extend_edge_coloring_by_write`; rounds only APPEND edges and the
    greedy coloring is prefix-stable, so extending is exact.

    Interval edges (``budget is None``) carry a signed slab
    ``[s_low, s_high]`` in ``interval_bounds_by_index`` (keyed by ``iter_edges``
    position); they relax in the same color classes as the symmetric edges.

    ``node_ref`` — REFERENCE RODS (owner ruling 2026-07-29 #2, spec §7):
    ``{node: z_ref}``.  Each sweep starts with a small proximal pull of
    every referenced node toward its reference, THEN runs the cap
    projections and the box clamp — the law always wins locally and the
    exit state is always cap-projected.  Convergence: certified when a
    sweep applies no cap correction, no clamp move AND every pull is
    ≤ tol; a conflicted region instead reaches a pull↔projection
    EQUILIBRIUM, detected as a whole-sweep state change ≤ tol (the
    steady-state exit) — the caller's exact-return polish then settles
    slack nodes onto their references exactly.  ``None`` ⇒ byte-identical
    (and the feasibility pre-check shortcut stays available; with refs it
    is skipped — an all-satisfied system may still owe reference
    pulls)."""

    """Drive EVERY grade-graph edge to ``|Δelev| ≤ budget`` by iterative
    constraint projection (user 2026-06-25: nothing may violate a grade cap).

    This is a Gauss-Seidel relaxation of the difference-constraint system
    ``|z_i − z_j| ≤ cap_ij·d_ij`` on the SAME graph the validator checks
    (``shape_constraints`` = ``grade_graph``).  ``hard`` nodes (buildings, runway,
    seams) are immovable; everything else — including the route SKELETON — may
    flex.  An over-cap edge moves its free endpoint(s) just enough to satisfy it
    (split the excess when both are free, all of it onto the free one otherwise);
    repeated sweeps converge to a cap-Lipschitz surface whenever the anchors admit
    one.  Edges between two hard nodes are genuinely infeasible and reported, not
    forced.  Mutates ``elev`` in place; returns ``(remaining_over_cap, both_hard)``.

    EMIT-QUANTIZATION MARGIN: the sweeps (and the reach envelope) enforce
    ``budget − config.EMIT_QUANTIZATION_MARGIN_M`` (floored, see
    ``_margined_budget``) so the 0.01 m-rounded emitted elevations still satisfy
    the raw law; the returned over-cap tally is measured against the RAW budget
    (the true law — reporting is never tightened).

    ``flat_groups`` — optional list of node-index sets, each a RIGID FLAT group
    (a building pad): its members share ONE elevation that the projection may
    move as a unit (the feasibility-audit model — buildings are movable flat
    groups; holding every pad hard at its pre-picked seat makes the polytope
    infeasible through chained paths even when no single edge is both-hard).
    Each group collapses to a representative node; member↔member edges vanish,
    member↔outside edges re-anchor to the representative with their own budget,
    and the representative's final level is broadcast back to all members.  A
    group containing a ``hard`` node stays entirely hard (never moved).

    ``broken_out`` — optional set the caller passes to receive the BROKEN
    node indices this call quarantined (genuine anchor contradictions,
    blended + immovable — see below).  ``pre_broken`` — node indices to
    quarantine AT THEIR CURRENT VALUES in addition to the envelope's own
    detections (scoped final projection, user 2026-07-05: the solve's FULL
    graph proved these nodes sit in infeasible pockets; the scoped graph's
    sparser envelope can miss the contradiction and the worklist then grinds
    POCS on the infeasible subsystem to the visit cap, smearing the pocket —
    the exact failure the broken quarantine exists to prevent).  Quarantining
    extra nodes is always law-safe: their over-cap pairs are reported, never
    hidden.

    ``group_bounds`` / ``node_bounds`` — BOUNDED YIELD (owner ruling
    2026-07-29: "Any yield absolutely needs to stay within the feasibility
    box").  ``group_bounds`` is a list parallel to ``flat_groups``: entry k
    is the ``(lo, hi)`` interval group k's rigid level may take (``None`` =
    unbounded); merged groups intersect their boxes.  ``node_bounds`` is
    ``{node_idx: (lo, hi)}`` for individually freed nodes.  A bounded node
    clamps to its box at seed and after every step that moves it, so a
    yielded seat can never be dragged outside the reach-band interval it
    was seated from — a conflict that exceeds a box surfaces as a remaining
    over-cap edge in the final tally instead of burying the seat (HECA
    building199: seated 101.13, parked at 87.94 by the unbounded yield).
    A box is a refinement of the yield, never a new hold: immovable nodes,
    group members (the representative carries the value) and contradictory
    (``lo > hi``) boxes are dropped.  ``None`` for both = today's behavior,
    byte-identical.

    ``group_refs`` / ``node_refs`` — REFERENCE RODS (owner ruling
    2026-07-29 #2, spec §7): the yield solves "minimum displacement from
    the reference field, subject to the caps and the boxes", never "any
    feasible point".  ``group_refs`` is a list parallel to
    ``flat_groups`` (a merged rigid unit takes the size-weighted mean of
    its constituent references — the least-total-displacement level);
    ``node_refs`` is ``{node: z_ref}``.  Mechanically: the chromatic /
    Jacobi sweeps add a small proximal pull toward ``z_ref`` before each
    sweep's projections (the law always wins — see ``_project_chromatic``),
    and an EXACT-RETURN POLISH after the sweeps projects each reference
    onto the interval the node's own (current-neighbour) constraints and
    box admit — a node with no binding pair ends AT its reference
    exactly (owner clarification 2026-07-29: cap-lawful sag below the
    string is a forbidden answer; the surface leaves its reference only
    where a constraint forces it, minimally, in-box).  The legacy scalar
    worklist has no sweep structure, so with refs it enforces caps+boxes
    only and the polish supplies the reference semantics.  ``None`` for
    both = today's behavior, byte-identical.
