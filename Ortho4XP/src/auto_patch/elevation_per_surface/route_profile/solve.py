"""Top-level orchestration for the one-profile elevation solve.

``solve_route_profile`` (docs/one_profile_solve.md) is the ONLY pass that sets
airside elevations.  It reuses the proven, elevation-neutral primitives from
``solver_primitives`` (node list, seed, DEM sample, shape grade graph, level
coupling, writeback) and the route-feasibility building levels from
``building_feasibility`` — then runs the single :func:`one_profile_solve`
(one graph: the taxi-route reach band) over them.

        # envelope slab) and a DEM seed, so its converged value IS
        # ``min(dem_seed, reference + ceiling_offset(d))``.  The solve's
        # interval edge used the end's frozen-nearest pavement ANCHOR
        # VERTEX (the approximation that keeps the slab pairwise); the
        # law's actual reference is the pavement-EXIT elevation read 1 m
        # inside the exit — and THAT is the read the whole arc exists
        # for, because pre-solve it is stale by a measured median 0.110 m
        # (p90 0.150 m, max 0.164 m at CYXY; the mode is the crown, plus
        # ~0.4 m at overrun-pavement ends and up to
        # ``RUNWAY_FLEX_MAX_DISPLACEMENT_M`` under runway flex).  Here it
        # is re-read on the pavement shapes ``_writeback`` has just
        # written — solved AND crowned — and the one-slab projection is
        # re-evaluated against it.  ``clearance._resa_alt_at`` therefore
        # RETIRES as the source of emitted values under this gate; the
        # analytic values the emitter stamped pre-solve survive only on a
        # vertex the solve could not resolve (counted below).
        #
        # IDENTITY RULE (the zone rule): a cut vertex that ADOPTED a
        # pre-existing variable — a pavement ring vertex, a runway-end
        # SKIRT pin, a gap spine — or that interned with an earlier cut
        # vertex, takes that variable's solved value VERBATIM.  One node,
        # one value; re-evaluating the cut law there would mint a second
        # value for the same variable and re-open the twin-vertex class
        # this arc closes.
        #
        # NO SNAP-TO-BOUND (deliberate deviation from the zone twin,
        # documented for the lead): the zone corridor is two-sided and its
        # snap moves a value UP onto a floor or DOWN onto a ceiling.  The
        # cut corridor is ONE-SIDED — only a ceiling — and ``min(dem,
        # ceiling)`` already lands EXACTLY on that bound wherever it
        # binds, so the snap has nothing to gain; applying it in the
        # non-binding direction would lift the surface off the terrain by
        # up to ``_CORRIDOR_SNAP_TOL_M`` (0.15 m), i.e. FILL, which the
        # cut-only law and ``test_runway_end_resa_cut`` both forbid.  The
        # emitter's own 0.1 m quantum is kept verbatim so gate-ON and
        # gate-OFF values are directly comparable.

    # A post-solve feature weld can put a NON-runway hard pin — a runway-
    # end-skirt birth pin (B1: pinned pre-solve at the inverse-RESA floor)
    # or a runway-boundary-freeze capture — into a pavement ring a metre
    # from a runway-hard vertex, at a value the solve never graded against
    # the runway (measured KCLT 18L/36R: the skirt's lateral-overhang
    # corner pinned 227.54 sits 0.99 m from the runway corner 227.24 in a
    # junction ring = a 30 % ring step; the law pair IS in the projection
    # graph but BOTH endpoints are frozen, so the step ships).  The runway
    # is the datum (2026-07-16 ruling) and a weld that DISAGREES with it
    # is torn, not authoritative (the 2026-07-06 agreement gate).  The
    # repair: FIXPOINT-RE-SEAT the torn cluster — every re-seatable pin
    # with a violated law edge to the datum (or to an already re-seated
    # pin) has its value moved INSIDE the interval its datum-side edges
    # admit, while STAYING HARD.  Staying hard is the load-bearing part:
    # a FREED pin ping-pongs between the datum and the cluster's
    # remaining pins (measured KCLT: one freed node ground the worklist
    # heap 20+ min), and a freed-then-quarantined pin is re-blended by
    # the envelope pass onto the very contradiction being repaired (the
    # ``pre_broken`` merge happens after the envelope, which re-derives
    # its interval from the SAME remaining torn pins).  A hard pin skips
    # both; the writeback then carries the datum-lawful value into every
    # pavement ring holding the node, and at ``to_osm`` the authority
    # consensus carries it into the feature ring (pavement wins; the
    # skirt bends).  Re-seating is the converged projection of the
    # datum pairs applied directly — the sweep budget cannot be relied
    # on to reach them (measured KCLT late run: 42k edges over cap at
    # exit).  Tile-seam pins are the owner's seam law and never move.

    ``|g2 − g1| ≤ k_rate·(L1 + L2)/2`` (``TAXIWAY_MAX_GRADE_CHANGE_
    PER_M``, the taxiway vertical-curve K-factor analog) — applied to
    each gap-fill drainage-spine chain, with every centre-vertex move
    clamped INTO the node's envelope interval so smoothing never exits
    the law the interval edges enforce.  The interval is read at the
    CURRENT station elevations: ``[max over parents of (z_station +
    floor_offset), min over parents of (z_station + ceiling_offset)]``,
    ``None`` sides open; an EMPTY intersection falls back to the nearer
    (first) parent's own interval — the same composition rule the
    retired analytic valuation used (``gap_fill._spine_interval``).
    Spine ENDPOINTS never move (no triple centres them), matching the
    analytic smoother's pinned ends.  ``frozen`` (indexable of bool,
    e.g. ``base_hard``): HARD nodes never move either — a gap-spine
    vertex can weld onto a pavement node that is a runway-join anchor
    (the single hard anchor law: everything yields to it, including
    this smoother — KBNA 13/31: the fairing dragged an anchored join
    0.22 m below the crowned runway edge, user ruling 2026-07-16).

    ``chains``: ``solver_primitives._build_gap_spine_constraints``

    the chain into runs), coordinates, and resolved per-node specs
    ``[(station_index, floor_offset, ceiling_offset), ...]``.

    """Second-difference fairing on STRAIGHT airside boundary runs (user
    2026-07-04, CYXY taxiway E edge): the ``_fair_spine_chains`` law
    covers spine chains only, so a corridor's ring EDGE still tracks DEM
    noise in legal ±cap sawtooth (±0.8 % grade alternation every 12 m).
    Same POCS: a too-sharp sag lifts its centre, a crest lowers it,
    stiffness-split, band-clamped, anchors fixed.  Ring CORNERS are real
    grade breaks — a triple only fairs when the boundary is straight
    through it (bend ≤ ``max_bend_deg``).  Runways/buildings excluded
    (own profile / flat).  Mutates ``elev``; returns residual kinks.

    ``law_adjacency`` (``{node: [(other, budget_m), …]}``) makes the pass
    LAW-GUARDED: every move is clamped into the interval the node's law
    edges allow around the CURRENT neighbour values, and a node already
    outside that interval (a projection-declared residual) or with an
    infeasible interval never moves.  Required when the caller runs this
    AFTER its last feasibility projection — the unguarded pass left
    junction MESH chords (pairs crossing between two ring runs, which no
    triple sees) a median 1.8 cm over budget (SPJC 2026-07-05, the
    43-pair cm-noise class).  ``None`` ⇒ unguarded (solve-time call: the
    final projection re-enforces every pair the fairing perturbs).

    ``skip_nodes`` (node indices, arc R slice R1) — FREE TERRAIN-LEAF
    nodes: a triple with ANY of its three members in this set is dropped.
    ``_SKIP_ROLES`` below is ROLE-keyed, but the runway-end regime
    carries TWO families on ONE role: the skirt FILL (hard pins — every
    triple centre is already an anchor, so the pass is inert on it) and
    the RESA CUT (free variables under one envelope edge).  The cut
    carries no within-shape grade rule
    (``ROLE_GRADE_LIMITS['runway_clearance']`` is ``None``) and no
    fairing BY DESIGN — and, MEASURED at CYXY, a cut-ring triple whose
    CENTRE is the pavement vertex its weld row shares with a junction
    dragged that pavement node 2.1 m, breaking the one-way
    host-authority property the whole absorption rests on.  Dropping on
    ANY member (not just the centre) is what kills that class while
    leaving every triple that exists WITHOUT the admission untouched:
    off-gate no cut vertex resolves to a free node, the set is empty and
    the pass is byte-identical."""
