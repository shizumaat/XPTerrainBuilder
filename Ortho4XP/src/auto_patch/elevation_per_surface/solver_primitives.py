# ── Priority cascade (user 2026-05-22) ───────────────────────────
# The solver runs as an ordered cascade rather than one simultaneous
# relaxation: seam + runway corners are the immutable HARD anchors,
# then each lower tier is solved against the FROZEN tier above it.
# Grade is sacred at every tier; the cascade order decides who yields
# to preserve it.
#
#   seam / runway  (HARD)
#     → TAXI network (rects + junctions): graded between the runway /
#       seam intersections it touches, closest to DEM within the
#       taxiway grade cap.  This is the "grade the taxi network like
#       the runway" step — its anchors are the shared runway/seam
#       nodes (already HARD-seeded); everything between follows terrain
#       clamped to grade, dipping below / rising above only as needed
#       to span the anchors.
#     → APRONS: the taxi network is now frozen; each apron adjusts (as
#       a whole, within apron grade) to meet its taxiways at the
#       shared boundary nodes.
#     → TERMINALS: aprons frozen; the flat terminal floor adjusts to
#       connect to its aprons within grade.
#
# Why phased (not simultaneous): a single relaxation is a tug-of-war —
# an apron held at DEM by its own attraction pins a taxiway it borders,
# forcing the taxiway over-grade (SPLP junction -10025).  Freezing the
# higher tier and letting the lower tier yield removes that conflict.
#
# Priority cascade INVERTED (user 2026-05-23): solve from the TERMINAL
# outward to the runway, not the runway inward.  Aircraft park at the
# terminal (which must stay flat) and must be able to taxi to every
# runway within grade, so the terminal is the anchor and the runway
# yields last.  Order of authority (solved first, frozen for the rest):
#   seam / runway-CIFP (HARD) > TERMINAL (flat, DEM-mean) > APRON > TAXI.
# A node's OWNER tier = the highest-priority role among the shapes that
# use it (TERMINAL > APRON > TAXI); a node shared by a terminal and an
# apron is terminal-owned, so the apron yields to the flat terminal floor
# (this is what keeps the terminal whole-flat with aprons matching 1:1 —
# no separate post-flatten needed).  A taxiway/apron node is apron-owned.
# Lower tiers couple to frozen higher tiers through these shared HARD
# nodes, NOT through cross-tier edges — so each phase uses only its own
# tier's edges.  (Runway is still base-HARD here; making it yield as the
# last resort is a separate step.)



# Runway-flex third pass (user 2026-05-28).  The runway's elevation profile is
# DERIVED from the DEM (interpolated between CIFP threshold anchors); the DEM is
# the least-accurate part of the equation.  When a junction/stub cannot reach
# grade because it is wedged between a soft apron and a runway-anchored node
# that the DEM dipped/bulged (CYXY 14R/32L dips ~3 m to 691.4 around the 02/20
# intersection, forcing stub A to 8.9 %), the impossible connection has nowhere
# to go because EVERY runway node is HARD.  This pass keeps the real-world CIFP
# THRESHOLD endpoints hard but lets the runway's INTERIOR nodes flex within the
# runway grade cap, so the dip can rise toward the junction and the gap spreads
# over the runway's length instead of concentrating on the short connector.
# Only fires when a residual within-shape violation remains after the reverse
# pass (the impossible-connection signature) AND only commits if it strictly
# reduces the worst violation — so airports whose runway anchor is correct are
# untouched.  Makes the surface MORE faithful: CIFP thresholds are ground
# truth, pavement is known to exist and be gradeable, the DEM is the guess.
# Seam-level threshold-yield: the band solve tilts the runway through the hard
# seam, which can leave a residual vertical-curve kink at the seam crossing
# (eliminating it needs the seam's runway node anchored in the FAA smooth — a
# follow-up).  Allow this many marginal kinks so a grade-compliant seam yield
# still commits instead of leaving the runway grade-violating.

# DEM attraction (user 2026-05-22): each iteration, pull every SOFT node a
# fixed fraction of the way toward its terrain (DEM) elevation, THEN
# cap-project.  This makes soft pavement settle "as close to DEM as the
# grade caps allow" — the documented intent ("reach the highs and lows in
# DEM that are possible within grade limits").  Without it,
# cap-projection-only never RAISES a node that warm-started low (a prior
# pass's value) back toward terrain, so a taxiway/apron network spanning
# low terminals and high runways sinks several metres below its own
# terrain (HECA T4 / taxiway T cliff: stub T4 sat 7 m below runway 05C/23C
# because the genuinely-low south terminals drained the connected network
# via cap-chains).
#
# The pull is PERSISTENT (no decay): the equilibrium balances the DEM
# spring against the per-edge caps, so each node ends as close to DEM as
# its caps permit and the low terminals no longer diffuse across the whole
# field.  Convergence is still clean — a node free to reach DEM converges
# geometrically (rate ``1 − DEM_ATTRACTION``); a cap-pinned node settles
# where the spring pull and the cap push-back cancel (net per-iter change
# → 0).  A DECAYING weight was tried first and FAILED: once it decayed the
# pure-cap tail relaxed the network back to the low-terminal compromise
# (HECA below-DEM unchanged).

# Asymmetric DEM attraction (user 2026-05-22): grade > DEM, and a soft
# node must NOT be dragged BELOW its terrain unless grade toward a HARD
# anchor genuinely requires it.  A node sitting below its DEM was almost
# always pulled there by a cap-chain to a low connected shape (SPLP
# junction (4,503): every vertex 0.5-1.4 m below terrain, dragged by a
# taxiway descending to 64 m — even though the local terrain is flat ~72
# and a flat junction/stub would be grade-compliant).  So pull UP toward
# terrain STRONGLY (restore it); pull DOWN gently.  Grade still wins: the
# cap-projection runs AFTER this each iteration, so a node that truly
# must sit below DEM to stay within grade of a lower HARD anchor is
# pushed back down (the spring just sets the target, the cap has the last
# word).

# frontage and CAN be considered for co-levelling, BUT they only actually merge
# when the apron between them cannot bridge their independent balanced levels at

# along a long corridor whose levels step gently (apron <= 1.5%) therefore stays
# INDEPENDENT and the apron slopes between them — only buildings whose level gap
# the apron can't span share one level.

# APRON_BACK_EDGE_RAMPS: max law-window INVERSION (metres) for which a terminal
# still flattens (at the inverted-window midpoint) instead of sloping — a mild
# serving-corridor conflict the user wants flat; larger conflicts slope.

# APRON_BACK_EDGE_RAMPS: max summed apron-excess (metres) a flatten may ADD and
# still be accepted — lets the apron grade to MEET a flat pad with marginal
# over-cap residual instead of reverting the pad to a slope; genuinely-
# infeasible pads (metres of free-apron excess) still exceed it and slope.

# Max move for the terminal LEAF re-level toward the adjacent-apron median

    soft pavement shape with ``{nodes, edges, flat}`` — its node indices, its
    OWN internal grade edges ``(i, j, cap_m)``, and whether it must stay flat
    (terminal).  Rects use flat-cross (cap≈0) + axial edges; aprons use the
    in-pavement VISIBILITY graph (geodesic, see ``_visible_grade_edges``);
    junction/seam-rect use all-pair; terminal is flat.  Runway/seam are HARD,
    not included.

    ``ctx``: optionally a prebuilt ``grade_graph.build_context`` — pass the
    SAME one ``build_unified_graph`` will use so the per-shape law memo
    (``grade_graph.shape_constraints_cached``) computes each shape once.

    FLATNESS-CERTIFIED LAZY TIER (user 2026-07-05, gate ``O4_FLAT_SHAPE_LAZY``
    default on; needs ``dem``/``tile_lat``/``tile_lon`` + ``hard_nodes`` from
    the caller): an apron/junction shape whose local DEM gradient is provably
    below ``0.6 · APRON_MAX_GRADE`` (see ``_certify_flat_shape``) gets only
    its O(n) ring-adjacent pairs eagerly; its entry additionally carries
      * ``lazy_expand`` — thunk returning the FULL ``(i, j, budget)`` list
        (the exact eager generation, memoised via
        ``grade_graph.shape_constraints_cached``),
      * ``lazy_nodes`` / ``lazy_seed`` — the node indices and their DEM seed
        values at certificate time,
      * ``lazy_certified`` — permanent marker (hit-rate reporting).
    ``one_solve.feasibility_project`` expands the entry the moment any of its
    nodes moves off the seed; until then the certificate proves every body
    pair satisfied.  Shapes touching a ``hard_nodes`` member (runway / seam /
    join — they sit at profile values, not the DEM seed) are never certified.

    SCOPED FINAL PROJECTION (user 2026-07-05, ``O4_SCOPED_FINAL_PROJECTION``):
    ``defer_shape_ids`` — apron/junction shapes (by ``id(s)``) the caller has
    PROVED unchanged since the solve's writeback (ring geometry identical +
    every node value identical + no law-context input touching them changed —
    see ``route_profile.solve._scoped_projection_defer_ids``).  Their full
    pair set was already enforced by the solve on identical rings/values, so
    the entry is a pure lazy stub: NO eager edges, ``lazy_expand`` = the same
    full generation, movement tolerance 0 (any node the projection moves
    voids the proof and expands the entry through the standard lazy
    machinery).  The caller MUST fill ``lazy_seed`` with its own seed values
    before projecting (left ``None`` here so an unfilled stub fails loudly).
    Terminals, rects and service junctions keep their eager branches (they are
    flat / cheap / all-pair-small; the O(n²) cost lives in apron/junction).
    NOTE: ``one_solve._build_adjacency`` consequently sees only the ring edges
    of a certified shape for its neighbour-cap slabs — acceptable: that is a
    heuristic bound and every node is re-projected against the full law
    afterwards (the projection expands on first movement).

    FLAT-SITE FAST PATH (docs/specs/flat-site-fast-path-spec.md §1):
    ``born_flat_shape_ids`` — shapes (by ``id(s)``) every one of whose ring
    vertices is a HARD PIN at exactly Z0.  They get NO entry at all: no eager
    edges, no lazy stub, no nodes.  This is not a deferral like the two tiers
    above — a shape whose every variable is fixed at ONE value has no within-
    shape law left to enforce (grade 0 satisfies every cap), and its nodes
    remain first-class BOUNDARY VALUES for the neighbours that share them,
    which read them through their own entries.  ``None`` (the default, and
    every call with the gate off) is byte-identical to before."""

    THE LAW (owner ruling 2026-07-24): terrain beyond a runway end must
    stay inside ``grade_law.runway_end_envelope``, and that envelope is
    LAW THE SOLVER ENFORCES, not geometry stamped after the fact.  For
    the CUT direction the envelope is one-sided by construction — a
    ceiling (the RESA ramp off the pavement-exit elevation) and a ``None``
    floor, because a drop beyond the end is the FILL regime's business
    and the cut never fills.

    ENCODING — the B3 band template with the lower side open: exactly ONE
    interval 4-tuple ``(cut_index, anchor_index, None, ceiling_offset(d))``
    per cut vertex, i.e. the B0 signed slab ``z_cut − z_anchor <=
    ceiling_offset``, plus the DEM seed ``_seed_elevations`` already
    provides.  No transverse edges, no longitudinal edges, no fairing:
    ``config.ROLE_GRADE_LIMITS["runway_clearance"] is None`` — the cut
    carries no within-shape grade rule — so projection of the DEM seed
    onto the one-sided slab IS the analytic ``min(ceiling, DEM)`` clamp
    (parity by construction, the B3 argument verbatim).  The one-sided
    form is already supported by the projection (``one_solve``) and the
    runway-flex hook already skips one-sided intervals.

    ANCHOR: the end's FROZEN-NEAREST pavement ring vertex, chosen at
    construction time by the emitter (``clearance``'s ``anchor_xy``) —
    the B2/B3 frozen-nearest coupling pattern.  Its solved value tracks
    the pavement-exit elevation the envelope is referenced to; the exact
    reference frame is restored at writeback (the foot re-reference
    discipline), so the anchor approximation never reaches the emitted
    value.

    IDENTITY-COLLISION RULE (the B3 rule, and the reason this arc closes
    the twin-vertex class): a cut vertex whose canonical bucket resolves
    to a PRE-EXISTING variable — index below
    ``layout._terrain_host_yield_first_index``: a pavement ring vertex, a
    runway-end SKIRT pin, a gap spine — gets NO edge.  It ADOPTS that
    variable by identity (pavement value always wins at a pavement node;
    a cut law edge must never constrain a pavement variable, and a cut
    vertex shared with the FILL cannot disagree with it because there is
    only one variable).  A vertex interning with an EARLIER cut vertex
    likewise gets no second edge — the first claimant's corridor governs,
    since two slabs on one variable is the measured B2 ping-pong class.

    THE LAW (owner rulings 2026-07-27, anchor-rect revision —
    docs/specs/eat-anchor-rect-spec.md): an end-around taxiway crosses
    the extended centreline beyond a runway end, so its pavement must sit
    low enough that the design aircraft's TAIL clears the departure (FAA
    40:1 from the DER) / take-off-climb (EASA 2 % from a 60 m inner edge)
    surface.  KATL taxiway Victor runs ~9 m below its runway end for
    exactly this reason.

    ENCODING — a HARD ANCHOR, not a law edge.  The first implementation
    hung one-sided pavement↔pavement interval edges on the governed
    nodes; their negative slab weights blew up the reach-envelope
    Dijkstra (non-negative weights only; KCLT killed at 15 min CPU /
    20.3 GB).  Here the RECT — corridor about the extended centreline at
    the runway's DECLARED half-width (``half_width_m``; apt.dat row-100
    width, shoulders excluded), intersected with taxi/junction/apron
    pavement beyond ``EAT_MIN_CROSSING_DIST_M`` — is PINNED at the
    regulation value

        ``end_elev + eat_pavement_ceiling(D_mid, slope, setback, tail)``

    UNCONDITIONALLY (owner: "anchoring it at the regulation is the right
    course, even if it has to fill DEM" — no min-with-terrain
    refinement).  ``end_elev`` is the SOLVED runway-end value read off
    the end's frozen-nearest pavement ring vertex (profiles freeze
    before the field solve, so it is a constant here); ``D_mid`` is the
    crossing segment's mid-distance from the DER along the outward
    vector.  The pins then ride the same positive-weight anchor
    machinery as crossing runways and tile seams: reach bands propagate
    ``E_anchor ± cap·d`` outward and the solve grades the descent/climb
    ramps at taxi caps — no solver change, no negative edge anywhere.

    Governed vertices cluster into connected CROSSING SEGMENTS by
    along-centreline gap (``EAT_RECT_SEGMENT_GAP_M``) — one segment per
    EAT, each pinned FLAT at its own ``D_mid`` value (the rect is short
    along the direction of EAT travel).  Where two ends' corridors
    overlap one segment, the LOWER value wins (the most restrictive
    surface governs, deterministically).  A node that is ALREADY hard
    (runway ring, tile-seam pin, bridge deck, skirt birth pin) is never
    overridden — the runway profile and the seam law outrank the rect.

    Called from ``_seed_elevations`` AFTER every senior pin family, so
    ``elev``/``is_hard`` reflect the runway profile the anchor read
    needs.  Returns ``(pins, counts)`` — ``pins`` maps node index →
    regulation value; ``counts = (n_segments, n_no_anchor,

    zone rows (ratified mechanism 2026-07-11; the LAW trace — the order-2
    scout refutation, recorded in the corrected design doc: the analytic
    band valuation is a PER-VERTEX two-sided envelope clamp of the DEM
    against the host-edge-referenced corridor,

        value = clamp(dem, edge + floor_offset(d), edge + ceiling_offset(d)),

    with NO neighbour coupling of any kind — ``config.ROLE_GRADE_LIMITS
    ['graded_strip'] is None``, and the only frontage coupling in the
    band machinery is the daylight benching of FOOTPRINT DEPTHS, which
    stays construction-side.  The encoding is therefore exactly ONE
    two-sided envelope interval edge per zone node to its frozen-nearest
    host pavement ring vertex (the B2 frozen-nearest pattern) plus the
    DEM seed ``_seed_elevations`` already provides: no transverse cross
    edges, no longitudinal edges, no fairing.  Projection of the DEM
    seed onto the signed slab IS the analytic clamp).

    NOTE on ``floor_off`` / ``ceil_off``: they are the law envelope at the
    node's depth SHIFTED, where the constructor had to re-home a
    tile-seam-PROLONGED (synthetic) host onto a real ring vertex, by
    ``station frontage altitude - re-homed host altitude`` — see the
    frozen-nearest host repair in
    ``adjacent_ground.construct_adjacent_ground_presolve``.  Without that
    shift a station up to a full prolongation away in station would be
    anchored to the cut-back corner's altitude.  The shift is 0.0 for
    every un-re-homed node, i.e. everywhere outside a seam prolongation.

    IDENTITY-COLLISION RULE: a zone node whose canonical bucket resolves
    to a PRE-EXISTING solver node (a pavement ring vertex, a gap-spine
    node — index below ``layout._adjacent_ground_first_zone_index``)
    gets NO edge: the band ADOPTS that variable's value by identity
    (pavement value always wins at a pavement node — an identity, not
    an arbitration; a band law edge must never constrain a pavement
    variable).  A zone node whose bucket was already claimed by an
    EARLIER zone node of the SAME HOST (cross-row interning inside the
    0.5 m registry tolerance) also gets no second edge — the first
    claimant's corridor governs; attaching both would hand the POCS
    sweep two disjoint slabs on one variable (the measured B2
    empty-intersection ping-pong).  Both collision classes are counted
    and reported (the design doc's open-question-2 assertion).

    CROSS-HOST collisions no longer reach this rule: as of the 2026-08-05
    ZONE-NODE IDENTITY decision, two hosts' zone rows that intern to one
    bucket are SEPARATE solve variables (see :func:`_build_node_list`),
    resolved here through :func:`zone_node_index`.  Dropping the second
    host's edge was the old cost of sharing a variable — one variable
    cannot carry two per-host zone laws — so ``n_cross_claimed`` should
    now stay at 0 and a non-zero value means a host key failed to join.

    Soft node seeding priority (highest first):

        # still built and evaluated, but only to REPORT the residual the

        # ``O4_SEAM_PIN_CLAMP=1`` the historical POCS projection runs
        # unchanged.  Legacy rationale, still valid for that path:
        #
        # Raw per-pin DEM pins trace every terrain bump into the pavement
        # at the seam.  Pin↔pin pairs are exactly the class the
        # within-shape law exempts (both endpoints hard), so a local
        # terrain notch at the band edge emits as a pavement dip (SPLP:
        # mirrored 1.2 m junction dips at 2.9 % over 45 m) — and
        # cap-violating pins also make the interior solve infeasible
        # (each pin pulls its soft neighbours toward itself; the GS
        # midpoints the conflict).  Project the pin values onto the
        # pairwise polytope ``|v_i − v_j| ≤ cap·path`` over CONSECUTIVE
        # pins along each ring — soft intermediate vertices are skipped
        # but their path length counts: the law grades them onto the
        # pin-to-pin line, so the pins themselves must be mutually
        # cap-feasible over that path (adjacent-vertex-only pairs missed
        # pins separated by soft nodes — SPLP emitted a 2.5 % straight
        # line between two band-edge pins 45 m apart).  POCS, violation
        # split equally (the minimum-movement projection); runway pins
        # are IMMOVABLE profile authority, their neighbour takes the
        # whole move.  Ring paths keep the coupling inside one pavement
        # shape — no reach across grass gaps — and terrain adherence is

    # docs/slice_b_solver_absorption_design.md §B1.  The runway-end skirt
    # is the first terrain feature absorbed into the one-solve graph.  Its
    # rings are built PRE-SOLVE (pipeline, before the solve call) and every
    # ring vertex carries a birth-computed profile value in the shape's
    # ``node_altitudes`` (the inverse-RESA law floor, derived from the
    # already-hard runway profile).  Here each such vertex becomes a HARD
    # PIN at that value — the object-bridge deck-pin pattern (above),
    # mirrored: the pin SOURCE is the shape's own per-vertex
    # ``node_altitudes`` (the skirt carries its values ON the shape, unlike
    # the plates whose values live in ``_object_bridge_pin_values``), so no
    # parallel bucket dict is minted — but the APPLICATION (elev / is_hard /
    # have_initial + the seam-pin protection set) is identical.  The solver
    # grades the neighbouring pavement to MEET these pins and never reshapes
    # them; ``_writeback`` skips ROLE_RUNWAY_CLEARANCE, so the immutable
    # ring keeps its birth values.  Runs after the bridge block so a skirt
    # vertex coinciding with a deck pin yields to the deck (pavement/deck
    # value wins), and after the seam block for the same reason.  GATED:
    # the roles are admitted to the node list only under
    # ``admitted_terrain_roles()`` (master + sub-gate), so with the gate off
    # ``idx`` is never found for a skirt vertex and the block is a no-op —
    # and until B1 moves construction pre-solve no skirt shape is even
    # present at solve time, so the block is doubly inert off-gate.

    # admitted families with OPPOSITE encodings — the skirt FILL is a hard
    # pin (here), the RESA CUT is a free variable under a one-sided

# ── Stage 6: write elevations back to layout shapes ──────────────


# ── R8-2: NO SOLVED VALUE LEAVES ITS REACH BAND (the canyon law) ──
# (docs/specs/round8-vhhh-closeout-spec.md R8-2, owner in-sim VHHH
# 1.0.232.)  MEASURED: at every VHHH runway end the ``graded_strip``
# bands carried solved edge altitudes of -10..-13 m against reach bands
# of [4.6, 9.4] — the sidecar's own ``band_excess`` recorded 199
# floor-side escapes to 17.15 m.  The band emitter and every DEM path
# were exonerated by recon; the escape happens in solver WRITEBACK.
#
# THE LAW (this is the standing band doctrine, now ENFORCED): the
# writeback clamps every solved value to its unified reach band BEFORE
# any consumer reads it — THE band the solve computed and carried, in
# THE frame it was computed in (round 9 §§1-3; the clamp resolves, it
# does not build).  ``adjacent_ground`` consumes the pavement edge
# altitudes this function stamps (``_build_fill_bands(edge_stations,
# edge_alts, ...)``) — the clamp lives HERE, upstream at the writeback,
# and not per-consumer, so one implementation covers every reader of a
# solved shape altitude.
#
# A CLAMP IS EVIDENCE, NEVER SILENCE.  Each clamp increments a counted,
# logged finding (site + delta) recorded on the layout as
# ``band_clamp_findings`` — the ``object_pad_findings`` pattern.  A clamp
# means some solver stage published a value outside the interval its own
# graph says is reachable; that is a defect to chase at the ship gate,
# and the count is how it stays visible.  Root-causing WHICH stage wrote
# -12.5 needs an interventional arm and is ledgered in
# ``docs/DEFERRED_VERIFICATION.md``, not done here.
#
# TWO SCOPING FACTS, both deliberate:
#   * ROLE_RUNWAY is NOT clamped.  Runway altitudes are CIFP-hard
#     (immutable through the solver, "airside is king") and the band
#     checker exempts them by construction (``exempt_runway_datum``), so
#     a runway clamp could only fight the CIFP datum and could never
#     move the acceptance metric.
#   * The floor is the convergence guards' 0.01 m, the same floor
#     ``grade_graph_validate.FINAL_BAND_EXCESS_MATERIALITY_M`` quotes.
#     Anything under it is numerical noise (and sits under the checker's
#     own 0.03 m ``ELEV_ROUNDING_NOISE_M`` too, so no clamped value can
#     become a material row).
WRITEBACK_BAND_CLAMP_MATERIALITY_M = 0.01

    ONE BAND (round 9, spec ``round9-writeback-band-frame-spec.md`` §2).
    ``solve_route_profile`` mints the ``env_band`` store artifact at the
    line that BUILDS the band — keyed by canonical point, in the uncrowned
    profile space — and every reader resolves THAT.  This function is the
    writeback's resolver, nothing more: it never builds a band.  The
    predecessor did (a node-list rebuild → unified graph →
    ``reach_band_unified`` at writeback time), and a second construction
    is a second law: it ran after the crown field was published, so its
    anchor seeds were de-crowned in a frame they were never in, and its
    ``reach_band_unified`` call overwrote the layout's FINAL band record
    with the crown-shifted snapshot the post-solve law assert then judged.

    Contract: ``band(x, y) -> (floor, ceiling) | None``; ``None`` at a
    point means off-net (the within-shape law governs it) and nothing is
    clamped there.  Lookup is the ``crown.crown_drop_at`` idiom verbatim —
    the same canonical registry at the same tolerance — because the key
    space is the same key space.

    Returns ``None`` — loudly, once — when no band was carried (an early
    solve return, a probe layout, a caller with no registry), in which
    case NOTHING is clamped and the writeback is exactly the pre-clamp
    writeback.  A band-less writeback is not a reason to fail a build; it
    IS a reason to say so, because a silently band-less airport clamps
