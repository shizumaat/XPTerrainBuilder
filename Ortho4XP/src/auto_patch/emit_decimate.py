"""Emit-time 3D-collinear vertex decimation (user design 2026-07-03).

Node density should follow the SOLVED profile, not a fixed step: an interior
ring vertex that lies on the straight line between its kept neighbours in XY
AND in Z is lossless to remove — X-Plane interpolates linearly along the
segment, so the rendered surface is identical while the patch, the Ortho4XP
triangulation and the sim mesh all shrink.  This recovers the rect-era
economy (a flat straight = ONE segment, zero interior nodes) on the sliced
model, while vertical transitions keep exactly the nodes that carry their
curvature (those sit off the 3D line and are never dropped) and junctions /
arcs keep their density (XY deflection protects them).

Measured before building this (SPJC, step-24 patch): 39 % of airside ring
vertices are 3D-collinear at a 2 cm band.

CONFORMANCE BY CONSTRUCTION: a vertex is removed only if EVERY ring that
contains it (across all shapes, exteriors and holes, processed or not) agrees
it is removable — so a shared-edge chain drops the same nodes on both sides
and no T-vertices are minted.  Along the RING the law can only improve: the
grade of the pair between two kept neighbours is the length-weighted mean of
the removed sub-segments' grades.  BUT a junction's MESH is re-triangulated
by the removals — the decimated ring's Delaunay has interior chords the
pre-decimation law never contained, so this pass MUST run BEFORE
final_grade_projection (which then enforces the decimated-ring law — the
mesh X-Plane actually renders).  Discovered 2026-07-05: with decimation
last, SPJC carried 18 junction mesh chords at 1.5-1.8 % nobody ever
enforced.

Gate ``O4_EMIT_DECIMATE`` (default on).  Z tolerances: airside 0.02 m; the
BOUNDARY ribbon 0.10 m — its per-station altitudes carry raw DEM jitter, and
the DEM under an airport is 3-arc-second SRTM (~90 m posts, metres of noise)
smoothed over ~700 m, so a 10 cm band is far below the data's own noise
floor.
