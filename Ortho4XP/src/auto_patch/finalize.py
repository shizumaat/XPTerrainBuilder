"""Post-phase-1 finalisation: elevation field, geometry repair, and
terrain-transition feature emit.

Run after ``pipeline.build_airport_pavement`` has emitted the
phase-1 geometry layout (rects, junctions, terminals, runways).

Two public entry points:

``compute_elevations_and_repair_geometry``
  * Runway FAA-profile elevations via ``elevation._compute_elevations``
    (under the legacy solver this also solves pavement; under the
    per-surface solver pavement is solved later in pipeline.py).
  * Geometry repair passes (shared-vertex enforce + overlap clip)
    to handle subdivisions / decompositions the elevation step may
    have introduced.
  * Junction-altitude reconciliation (legacy solver only).

``emit_terrain_transition_features``
  * Airport boundary ribbon, groundside pavement, boundary→DEM
    bridges; taxi/road bridges + tunnel portals when
    ``EMIT_BRIDGES_AND_TUNNELS``.
