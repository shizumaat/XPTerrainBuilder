"""THE single within-shape grade-constraint graph (solver AND validator).

This module is the ONE place that decides *which* vertex pairs of a soft airside
shape are grade-constrained and *at what cap*.  Both the elevation solver
(pre-emit, from ``layout.shapes``) and the grade validator (post-emit, from the
OSM ways) build the same representation-agnostic input and call
:func:`build_grade_constraints` — so the surface we *build* and the surface we
*check* can never drift again (see ``docs/single_grade_graph.md``).

It is deliberately self-contained and clean-room: it does NOT import the legacy
``check_grade.iter_shape_grade_constraints`` / per-axis machinery.

Model (user, authoritative 2026-06-23) — a soft airside shape is **spine + body**:

* **spine**  = taxi centerline(s) through the shape (after ``junction_spine``
  slicing the centerline is a real shared edge with nodes ON it).  A pair of
  spine nodes on a COMMON centerline is graded at the **taxiway per-letter cap**
  (A/B 3 %, C–F 1.5 %) — the centerline is a taxiway even inside an apron/junction.
* **body**  = every other mutually-visible pair, graded at the shape's **body
  cap**:
    - apron   → ``APRON_MAX_GRADE`` (1 %),
    - junction → the taxiway per-letter cap of its spine (so a junction is uniform
      at the taxiway cap; a junction with NO spine inherits the cap from the
      nearest connected taxiway-sized shape),
    - service_junction → ``SERVICE_ROAD_MAX_GRADE`` (5 %).

Rects (4-corner sloping planes), terminals (flat pads), runways (FAA profile) and
groundside (DEM) are NOT handled here — the solver keeps their plane/flat/profile
models (a correct planar rect already satisfies the convex all-pair check, so
they are not a lockstep gap) and the validator keeps its own per-role handling for
them.  This module owns the apron/junction visibility graph only.

#       so a point beside a long straight taxiway attaches to a vertex up
#       to half a segment away: measured off-leg overstatement p90 77.5 m,
#       max 454.5 m, and the owner's ON-CENTRELINE vertex was charged a

# no arc credit; a far interior chord with no route keeps isotropic

# taxi cap (never a service road's 5 % — the free-road ruling makes
# in-apron road pavement apron) while the TRANSVERSE cap stays the
# pair's own (apron 1 % across).  Without this the apron's isotropic
# 1 % all-pair web overrides the spine's 1.5 % — the composed

    * ``Δs⊥`` = the residual transverse offset, ``√(max(0, sep² − long_chord²))``
      — so ``Δs∥² + Δs⊥² = sep²`` exactly: the decomposition is a rotation of

    review 2026-07-03): near curves two physically-CLOSE points project far

    12.5 % over 5.2 m ruled legal at a nominal 1.5 % cap): visible cliffs

    continuous — the surface gradient between them is what the standards
    regulate, so the budget must be built from the direct separation, only
    ROTATED into (∥, ⊥) so ``cL``/``cT`` anisotropy still applies.

    THE single decomposition primitive — the anisotropic allowance is then
    ``Allowance.at(Δs∥, Δs⊥) = cL·Δs∥ + cT·Δs⊥`` (``grade_law``); the solver and
    validator both call it, so the built and checked surfaces use identical math.

    indexed so an emitted-OSM reader can consume the solver's mesh 1:1 instead
    of re-triangulating the EMITTED ring.

    Why: ``layout.to_osm`` repairs rings at emit (buffer(0), needle-vertex
    removal, ~0.5 m canonical-point interning), so the emitted junction ring
    can differ from the ring the solver triangulated — GEOS Delaunay then
    facets it DIFFERENTLY, and the validator checks mesh chords the solver
    never constrained (SPJC 2026-07-05: 44 genuine mesh/ring pairs a median
    1.8 cm over allowance).  With this structure the validator asks "was this
    pair a SOLVER mesh edge" by matching each emitted ring vertex to the
    nearest exported mesh vertex within ``SHARED_VERTEX_TOL_M`` (the one
    canonical node identity, 2026-06-30).

    An emitted vertex with NO solver counterpart within tolerance (e.g. a
    buffer(0) self-touch vertex minted at emit) matches nothing, so its body
    chords skip as phantom — the solver never constrained them, and checking
    them against a mesh the solver never built is exactly the noise class this
    removes.  Ring-adjacent pairs are unaffected (the law never consults the
    mesh for them).

    Vertex identity is the exact meter-coordinate tuple: both endpoints of a
    shared solver vertex serialize to the same rounded lat/lon, so they

    SCOPED FINAL PROJECTION (user 2026-07-05, ``O4_SCOPED_FINAL_PROJECTION``):
    ``skip_edge_shape_ids`` — apron/junction shapes (by ``id(s)``) whose
    within-shape ``G.edges`` contribution is SKIPPED (their positions are
    still registered).  Only ``final_grade_projection`` passes this, for
    shapes it proved unchanged since the solve — their identical pair set is
    carried by that caller's lazy entries instead, so law coverage is
    unchanged.  ``include_spine=False`` additionally skips the global spine /
    runway-anchor stages (``spine_adj`` and
    ``runway_anchor`` consumers), which that caller never reads — it uses
    ``G.edges`` only.  Defaults reproduce the full graph exactly.

    # centerline's runway-edge endpoint (CYXY taxiway A: the centerline endpoint
    # is the runway-edge MIDLINE at (-345,914), but the welded spine/runway nodes
    # are its two SIDE contacts 22.6 m away — past _NEAR_M=18 — so A was left
    # reach-detoured ~700 m and its served building over-credited 706 vs ~699).
    # So anchor every spine node that coincides with a runway vertex AND sits near
    # a TERMINATING contact endpoint (within _EDGE_REACH_M) — the route ends at the
    # runway there, exactly like a junction pavement edge.  The endpoint gate
    # excludes a taxiway that merely CROSSES / runs ALONG a runway mid-centerline
    # (SPJC taxiway F at (2136,-1677), 36 m from F's nearest endpoint) — those are
    # handled by the runway-crossing reconciliation, and hard-anchoring them
    # over-constrains the adjacent junction (a 0.16 m floor flag).  ``setdefault``
    # keeps any centerline-based anchor set above.  Gate O4_RUNWAY_CONTACT_ANCHOR=0.
