"""Groundside (curbside / drop-off / parking) pavement emit.

Pulls roads tagged as airport-access or service highway out of the
OSM cache, lifts them off the DEM, and emits matching curbside
ribbon polygons.  Then prunes orphan junction polygons that are
fully contained inside (or touch only) the groundside ribbon —
those are road-island fragments that don't belong with airside
pavement.

    defect): the merged lot+road polygon is ONE surface and gets graded as

    were graded by different authorities; one authority over the whole
    merged ring removes it at source, and the ring limiter bounds every
    adjacent pair including the sub-metre ones.

    Returns the worst adjacent ring grade after the regrade (for the

    step; interior vertices are carried over exactly, and a cut that
    genuinely falls mid-segment interpolates only there — at least a
    full sample step from any original vertex.  A blind ``substring()``
    minted endpoints ~mm off source vertices, and the solver/validator
    budget lockstep test caught exactly that (CYXY: one shared edge,
    7.7e-5 budget drift on near-duplicate vertices).

# LATERAL-CONTIGUITY GRADE LAW — clauses (2)-(5)
# (owner-confirmed FINAL 2026-08-02; the law itself is
#  ``grade_law.lateral_contiguity_cap`` / ``…_segments``)
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Clause (1) — the FREE road — is ``free_road_subsegments`` above: only the
# sub-segments with nothing paved beside them ever reach the slice, so a road
# inside an apron is absorbed by NEVER BEING CARVED.  This pass is the same
# ruling for the roads that DO exist as their own faces: at every station of a
# road-family shape it takes the laterally-contiguous paved cross-section,
# reads the strictest cap present, and either ABSORBS the stretch into the
# adjacent surface (clause 4, the preferred form) or, where the surface that
# owns the cap is not the piece's own neighbour, carries the cap on the piece
# (``BuiltShape.lateral_cap`` — solver + validator lockstep).

# The station walk itself is ``auto_patch.lateral_contiguity`` — ONE
# instrument, shared verbatim with ``tools/check_grade``'s twin, so the two
# readers cannot census different station sets (they did, once: a road the
# validator flagged had never been walked by the emitter's own axis
# convention — SPLP way -10009).

    """Clauses (2)-(5) of the lateral-contiguity grade law, per SEGMENT.

    ``rebind_only`` re-evaluates the CAP against the final pre-solve
    arrangement and changes NO geometry.  The law has to bind what actually
    ships: the geometric half (absorb / cut) must run early, while the
    conformance and planarize passes can still weld the rings it makes,
    but many passes move roles and split shapes between there and the
    solve — measured at HECA, 255 of 281 residual stations sat on shapes
    that carried no cap at all because they did not exist, or were not
    roads, when the geometric pass ran.  So the pass runs twice with ONE
    law and ONE walker: geometry early, the number late.

    For every road-family shape: walk its axis, read the laterally-contiguous
    paved cross-section at each 5 m station, and take the STRICTEST cap of the
    classes present (``grade_law.lateral_contiguity_cap``).  Consecutive
    stations of equal cap form a SEGMENT
    (``grade_law.lateral_contiguity_segments``); the shape is cut at the
    segment boundaries with the existing mouth machinery
    (``pavement.apron_necks._cut_at_mouth``, the transverse chord across the
    road at the boundary station), and each segment is then either:

      * ABSORBED into the adjacent surface that owns its cap (clause 4 —
        merged, so the road stops being a separate shape at all), when that
        surface is a LITERAL neighbour of the piece and neither side carries
        per-vertex altitudes (a DEM-followed groundside lot's
        ``node_altitudes`` align 1:1 with its ring, and a merge would
        silently misalign them); or
      * kept, carrying ``lateral_cap`` — the strictest cap, read by the
        solver (``grade_graph._body_cap``) and stamped for the validator.

    Stations inside a RUNWAY STRIP footprint get no verdict (clause 5: the
    strip footprint law supersedes there).

    ``dem_at`` (``f(x, y) -> Optional[float]``) is the groundside DEM
    sampler used to RE-GRADE a merged host as one surface
    (:func:`_regrade_merged_host`, ruling 2026-08-03: the merged lot+road
    polygon is ONE surface and gets graded as ONE).  ``None`` — synthetic
    callers and tests — leaves the merge's own field in place.

    History, so the reverted attempt is not re-tried: passing this sampler
    to ``_merge_piece_into_apron``'s ``alt_for_new`` instead, i.e. raw DEM
    for the NEW vertices only with the host's own left alone, was MEASURED
    WORSE (CYXY within-shape 189 → 275 rows) — the old/new boundary then
    carries the full DEM-vs-interpolated step at sub-metre spacing.  The
    merge is therefore still done with the interpolated field and the
    WHOLE ring is re-followed and ramp-limited afterwards.

    Returns a summary dict; ``layout.shapes`` is rebuilt in place.

    a service road is ONE corridor — its spine (the apt.dat truck-route
    centerline) has pavement on BOTH sides, and the two half-strips are
    the same surface.  The global slice cuts pavement by every
    centerline INCLUDING the road's own spine, so each road is born as
    two half-strips flanking the spine, and the carve / re-role /
    conversion passes add along-route fragment chains on top (CYXY
    around (60.70588, -135.07070): five sub-100 m² pieces for one
    ~30 m corridor run).  Solved independently they cannot grade as
    one surface.

    A shape is a corridor MEMBER when it is service pavement ridden by
    exactly ONE truck route (≥ ``route_through_min_m`` of the route
    inside/along it — a piece carrying two routes' interiors is a
    genuine road↔road intersection and is left alone) and its whole
    ring lies within ``max_corridor_halfwidth_m`` of that route (a wide
    lot only meets its route at the mouth and never qualifies).
    Members of the SAME route whose rings share a ≥ ``min_shared_m``
    boundary run merge — this joins both opposite-side half-strips
    (they share the spine seam itself) and along-route fragment chains.
    Small junction / service_junction slivers (≤
    ``absorb_fragment_area_m2``) that sit ON the route inside the
    corridor width DERIVED FROM THE MEMBERS BEING MERGED (never a
    constant — the road's actual pavement extent) are absorbed too
    (CYXY: the 8 m² full-width junction sliver at the corridor mouth).

    The merged shapes carry ``ROLE_SERVICE_ROAD`` (a corridor with one
    route through it grades AXIALLY along that route) and no altitudes
    — this runs PRE-solve so the corridor grades as one surface.

    Gate ``O4_FULL_WIDTH_SERVICE_CORRIDOR`` (default ON); off restores
    the old shattered-pieces behaviour byte-identically.  Returns the

    Per user 2026-04-29: pavement that wraps around the GROUNDSIDE
    of a terminal building (curbside, drop-off, parking) sits at a
    different elevation than the airside apron — at CYXY the
    terminal is cut into the hill so the airside apron is several
    metres lower than the road frontage.  The earlier subtraction
    pass (see ``_terminal_groundside_zone``) keeps the airside
    pavement clean of these strips, but they still belong in the
    output: they should render at local DEM elevation and should
    NOT touch the terminal building footprint (a 0.1 m gap is
    already applied during capture).

    Implementation:
      1. Iterate ``layout._groundside_polys`` (captured during
         ``build_airport_pavement`` immediately before the
         groundside subtraction).
      2. Densify each polygon's exterior to ``densify_step_m`` so
         per-vertex altitudes resolve at the same spatial
         frequency as the boundary ribbon (15 m step → typical
         curbside has 5–10 vertices per side).
      3. Sample DEM at every vertex; emit as ``BuiltShape`` with
         role ``ROLE_GROUNDSIDE_PAVEMENT``, ``node_altitudes`` set,
         and ``altitude``/``altitude_high``/``altitude_low`` left

    Per user 2026-04-29 (CYXY -10111 + -10115): the rect/junction
    tessellator can leave junction polygons sitting next to a groundside
    polygon when the apt.dat row-110 / DSF union has pavement outside the
    groundside-zone subtraction's perpendicular extent.  Those junctions
    get the airside-flat altitude during the solver (they were classified
    airside even though they don't touch any airside pavement), then they
    share an edge with the DEM-following groundside polygon at an altitude
    mismatch — X-Plane renders that as a cliff.

    Earlier versions DROPPED these junctions.  That was wrong (user
    2026-05-21): pav_union is the source of truth and these junctions
    cover REAL pavement — at HECA the DSF adds large terminal aprons with
    no taxi centerline that are vertex-disconnected from the airside
    network, and dropping them erased ~44k m² of genuine apron.  Instead
    we KEEP the pavement and re-elevate it to follow the DEM (like the
    groundside ribbon it abuts), which both preserves coverage AND removes
    the cliff — the original goal.

    Detection rule (a junction is reclassified if BOTH):
        1. It shares ≥1 vertex with a ``ROLE_GROUNDSIDE_PAVEMENT``
           polygon.
        2. It does NOT share any vertex with an airside seed shape
           (runway / primary_parallel / secondary_parallel / stub /
           cross_connector / terminal), directly or transitively through
           other junction polygons (BFS over junction-junction shared
           vertices) — so genuine apron→runway/terminal connectors are
           left airside (SPJC primary_parallels U and M relied on this).
