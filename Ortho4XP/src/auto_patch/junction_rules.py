"""Junction-refinement rule passes (user 2026-05-01).

Plan: ``/Users/noah/.claude/plans/kind-meandering-sifakis.md``.

Four rules apply as post-emission passes inside
``junction_emit.emit_junctions_and_finalize``:

* **Rule 1** — junction-runway 1:1 vertex sharing.
* **Rule 2** — snap junction vertices within ``SLOPING_EDGE_SNAP_M`` of
  a sloping rect's SLOPING edge to the rect's nearest cross-edge corner.
* **Rule 3** — for every junction, every edge that isn't a
  pavement-boundary arc and isn't a shared anchor edge must run
  parallel or perpendicular to the longest runway axis.
* **Rule 4** — split junctions at narrow necks; absorb the smaller
  piece into a neighbour or emit standalone.

Each pass mutates ``layout.shapes`` in place.

Implementation phase order (per plan): Rule 2 → Rule 1 → Rule 4 →
Rule 3.  Stubs raise ``NotImplementedError`` until landed.

    of a sloping-rect's SLOPING edge to the nearest of that edge's

    consecutive identical vertices.

    Per user 2026-05-04 (regression analysis): the rule operates on
    SLOPING edges only, NOT cross edges.  Snapping on cross edges
    pulls junction vertices that legitimately sit BETWEEN a rect's
    cross-edge corners — and which the polygon walks AROUND the rect
    via — onto one of the corners, distorting the polygon's wrap
    path.  At ``best-elevation-model`` (commit 187d2cd) total sloping-
    rect-vs-junction overlap was 0 m²; the all-4-edges variant in
    commit 5a50d00 introduced the V3 stub overlap, which was then
    band-aided with a "drop intervening verts" rule that produced
    self-intersecting polygons → buffer(0) splits → slivers along
    sloping edges.  Both changes reverted here.

    Flat-rect gate: skip rects whose altitude_high/altitude_low
    aren't set yet (which means they're either flat or per-surface-
    solver hasn't run; in both cases the corner-only sharing rule
    is unnecessary).  Re-runs after the post-elevation phase pick up
    rects whose altitudes are now set.

    When ``node_altitudes`` is set on a junction shape, drop the
    altitude entry alongside the vertex it corresponds to so the
    per-vertex altitude list stays aligned with the polygon's ring
    length.

    For each pavement vertex (junction / apron / parallel / stub /
    cross_connector) that lies within ``on_edge_tol_m`` of a terminal
    edge interior:

      * If the vertex is within ``snap_corner_m`` of one of that
        edge's endpoints (a terminal corner), rewrite the pavement
        polygon to use the corner instead — the pavement loses a
        vertex and gains exact alignment with the existing terminal
        corner.
      * Otherwise insert the vertex into the terminal polygon at the
        correct position along the edge — the terminal grows a
        vertex so it matches the pavement node.

    Either way both polygons end up with the same vertex sequence on
    the shared segment, so X-Plane renders a seamless meld with no
    sub-metre overlaps.

    ``node_altitudes`` is updated in lockstep with polygon rewrites.
    Run as the last geometry pass before OSM emit.

    on every shared boundary segment (user 2026-05-08).

    Two pavement polygons (junction / apron) are "adjacent" when one
    polygon's ring vertex lies within ``edge_tol_m`` of another's
    edge interior.  Without this pass, neighbouring junction
    polygons can have parallel edges that don't share OSM nids; the
    grade validator finds 6 m elevation gaps at mid-edge samples
    along those edges (SPLP junction-10053 ↔ junction-10054).

    For each pair where polygon A's vertex V lies on polygon B's
    edge E:
      * If V is within ``snap_corner_m`` of one of E's endpoints, no
        action — the vertex is effectively at a B corner already
        (and ``_enforce_shared_vertex_altitudes`` will average the
        two polygons' z at that bucket).
      * Otherwise insert a new vertex at V's exact (x, y) into B's
        ring with z linearly interpolated from E's endpoints.  After
        insertion, V and the new vertex are at the same XY → same
        OSM-emit bucket → ``_enforce_shared_vertex_altitudes``
        averages their elevations so the rendered surface meets at
        a single z at every shared point.

    Companion to ``stitch_pavement_to_terminals``; runs before the
    final altitude reconciliation chain at the end of
    ``build_airport_pavement``.
