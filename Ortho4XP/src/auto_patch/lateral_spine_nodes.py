"""Insert LATERAL corridor nodes on apron/junction edges (user 2026-06-26).

The within-shape grade check (and the solver) are vertex-pair based: a long
apron/junction edge running within taxi-width of a spine, with no intermediate
vertex, has nothing to sample — so a steep drop on the runway side of a risen
spine (CYXY building-19 apron) is invisible to BOTH the check and the solve, and
the apron just drapes to DEM.

This pass projects every spine centerline vertex perpendicularly onto any
apron/junction edge within ±half the taxi-width and inserts a vertex at the foot
(matching the spine nodes — no extra densification, per user).  The grade graph
then gains spine ↔ lateral-foot pairs (the lateral corridor grade is validated),
and the solver gains a node to grade that apron face down from the spine within
cap instead of draping it.

Runs PRE-SOLVE, after the spine is built and BEFORE the airside conformance, so
the inserted vertices are welded/propagated to neighbouring shapes too.

    A service road's law edges (it joins ``grade_graph.SOFT_VISIBILITY_ROLES``

    70-100 m with no intermediate vertex (the CYXY in-sim "ridge" report) —

    aligned cross-section pairs at station spacing: |Δz| across the road is
    then capped at SERVICE_ROAD_MAX_TRANSVERSE × width everywhere — the
    cross-road tear becomes unrepresentable.

    Same foot-insertion mechanics as :func:`insert_lateral_spine_nodes`
