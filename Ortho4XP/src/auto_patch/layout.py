"""PavementLayout + BuiltShape data model and serialisation.

Holds the pavement-builder's core data types (the dataclasses every
phase reads + writes), the role-tag vocabulary, the meter-anchored
projection helpers used to construct a layout, and the .osm
serialisation method (``PavementLayout.to_osm``).

Phase-1 (geometry) and Phase-2 (elevation) both populate
``BuiltShape`` instances inside a ``PavementLayout``; the .osm
emission turns the meter-space layout back into JOSM-readable
WGS-84 OSM with shared node IDs.

Public API:
    BuiltShape, PavementLayout              — data classes
    ROLE_*                                  — role-tag constants
    AEROWAY_FOR_ROLE                        — role -> aeroway tag value
