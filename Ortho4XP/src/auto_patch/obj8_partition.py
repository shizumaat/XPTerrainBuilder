"""Partition pooled OBJ8 geometry into structures via the contact graph.

Contract frozen by workstream W1 (amendment A1 of
``docs/dsf_object_integration_spec.md``); implemented in workstream W2.
The theory, the measurements, and the traps are in
``docs/obj8_structure_partition.md`` — read it in full before touching
this module.

The one-paragraph version.  With the correction
``delta(S, O) = ground_under(centroid(S)) - ground_under(anchor(O))``
applied to every vertex of structure ``S`` contributed by object ``O``,
the anchor term cancels at render time, so every structure moves as a
rigid body under pure vertical translation and its internal assembly is
preserved exactly.  All distortion therefore lives on structure
boundaries, which makes the optimal partition exactly the connected
components of the epsilon-contact graph: any coarser partition pays
residual for nothing, any finer partition tears contacting parts apart.
The only parameter is epsilon — a modelling tolerance ("how large a gap
did the author leave between a wall and its roof"), measured on a plateau
of 0.02–0.25 m at KCLT (``DSF_OBJECT_CONTACT_EPSILON_M``).

The trap (do not "fix" this): vertex-connectivity is NOT contact.  These
bakes are triangle soup — a wall abuts the roof it holds up without
sharing a vertex.  Partitioning on vertex-connectivity alone measured
4,453 torn abutments up to 11.39 m at KCLT.  Contact needs a broad phase
(3D axis-aligned bounding boxes, which is sound: box gap never exceeds
surface gap, so it can over-merge but never tear) and a narrow phase
(surface distance, pruning 43% of the broad-phase edges at KCLT).  A pair
whose contact cannot be PROVED absent keeps its edge — tearing is the
unrecoverable failure, over-merging costs centimetres (invariant I-20).

Narrow-phase honesty note: the surface-distance test is vertex-to-triangle
in both directions.  A pure edge-edge crossing with no vertex proximity is
missed by it — but for abutting building parts that configuration implies
interpenetration, which the vertex tests catch in practice (partition
document, section 3 step 3).

Frames: callers pool geometry across objects in AUTHORED space — world
XZ through each object's own placement, projected into one local
east-north-up frame centred on the pool, with y left as the authored
``v.y`` (never ``terrain(anchor) + v.y``).  The author assembled the
parts against a common assumed-flat plane; authored space is the frame
in which they fit (partition document, section 3 step 1).

Exactness caveat (amendment A7): the anchor cancellation equates our
mesh sample at the anchor with X-Plane's render-time terrain sample.
Those agree only up to DSF elevation-pool quantisation — a per-object
constant of roughly centimetres.  Within one object the assembly is
exact regardless.  Do not chase a 2 cm cross-object "tear".

# Co-baked payware packs chain independent buildings into airport-scale
# contact components through LINEAR CONNECTOR objects — fences,
# barriers, blast walls, light rows (measured EGGW: two components,
# 3.1 km / 2.6 km diameter, 55 + 44 resources, spans 38.2 / 26.5 m).
# The rigid-seat span gate rightly refuses one offset for such a chain,
# but that left EVERY member at its authored y: whole terminals, signs
# and stop-mark boards floated over the regraded ground.  A component
# wider than the split threshold can never be a rigidly-seatable body
# anyway, so it is RE-PARTITIONED with its linear-connector parts
# removed from the contact graph: each real building seats on its own
# offset, each connector seats (or span-skips) alone.  The accepted
# cost is a possible small vertical step where a fence meets a building
# across regraded ground — strictly better than the whole chain
# floating (the steps only appear where ground varies, exactly where
# the chain float was worst).  This deliberately amends the "no
# post-hoc splitting" note on ``connected_structures``: splitting is
# still forbidden for normally-sized structures; only never-seatable
# oversized chains are split, at connector joints only.  The threshold
# sits well above any REAL building complex (KCLT's terminal
# concourses with their thin load-bearing canopy members measure
# ~100-400 m and must never split — measured: a 100 m threshold
# fragmented them 220 -> 343 structures) and well below the measured

    vertex-to-triangle surface distance in both directions with early

    vertex array (a Python list of ~8 M tuples for the HECA pool) and
