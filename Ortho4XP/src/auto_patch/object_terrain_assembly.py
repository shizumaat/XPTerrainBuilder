"""Assemble a bridge/tunnel :class:`ClassificationResult` for one airport.

Workstream W-B of ``docs/object_terrain_features_spec.md`` — the *impure*
front end to the pure classifier (:mod:`object_terrain_features`).  Where
the classifier takes placements + geometry and returns records, this
module does the file work the classifier deliberately refuses: locate the
airport pack's overlay DSF, run the (cached) DSFTool text dump, read the
placements (``include_object_msl=True`` so KBNA's absolute deck fixtures
survive), load the referenced OBJ8 geometry, hand the pipeline's own
draped pavement in as the contract-coverage evidence, and — for the
depressed-road corridor re-source (spec section 3.2 step 3) — discover the
sibling roads pack's DSF road network on the same tile.

Everything here is gated behind ``config.OBJECT_BRIDGE_TERRAIN`` (default
off).  With the gate off :func:`attach_bridge_classification` is a no-op
that touches nothing and attaches nothing, so every downstream reader in
``bridges.py`` sees ``getattr(layout, ATTRIBUTE, None) is None`` and takes
its unchanged legacy path — the build is byte-identical to today.

The two artefacts cached on the layout when the gate is on:

* ``layout._object_bridge_classification`` — the
  :class:`object_terrain_features.ClassificationResult` (may itself carry
  empty ``bridges``/``tunnels`` when the pack has no such objects — KDFW —
  which is the designed "feature B does not fire, legacy handles it" path).
* ``layout._object_bridge_road_networks`` — a list of
  :class:`dsf_road_network.RoadNetwork` from every Custom Scenery pack that
  carries a vector road network on the airport's tile (the KBNA "US-KBNA
  Nashville Roads" pack is the exemplar; the bridged roads exist ONLY
  there).

The reader/loader APIs consumed here are all already merged and tested
(W-R1/W-R2/W-R3); this module wires them together and adds no new parsing.

ACCEPTANCE-LOOP RULE (round 6, measured the hard way): iteration builds
must run with ``O4_DSF_OBJECT_REANCHOR=0``.  The Phase 2 y-bake mutates
pack OBJ8 files; across repeated builds an unexcluded sibling part
(KBNA Taxiway-L p3) drifted until it qualified into the classifier pool
and moved the deck box.  The bake belongs after a FINAL mesh only.

    "no mesh sampling"), so a rebuilt mesh with unchanged pack files cannot
    change the classification and reusing it is sound.  The elevation-
    DEPENDENT artefact is the Phase 2 object y-bake, and that is recomputed
    against the current mesh on EVERY mesh build (``post_mesh`` reruns
    ``structure_deltas`` fresh and ``object_rebake.apply`` re-reads geometry
    from the ``.anchor_bak`` backup; the reanchor provenance sidecar is a
    diagnostic, not a rebuild-skip gate), so no stale delta is ever reused

    A1, ruling R12): born pre-solve tunnel-trench terrain as FIRST-CLASS
    layout shapes — the one-solve doctrine, mirroring
    ``bridges.build_bridge_layout_shapes``.

    Per classified tunnel (``classification.tunnels``, cached by
    :func:`attach_bridge_classification`):

    * **Datum** (the circular-datum rule): the object drapes at
      ``terrain(anchor)``, so the anchor's terrain is PINNED at layout as a
      solver INPUT — the DEM value at the placement anchor.
    * **Whole-body trench** (amendment A1): the WHOLE deck footprint (body +
      mouths) is cut, not the mouths alone — the roof OBJECT is the visible
      ground over the body, and terrain left at grade there would z-fight
      the roof slab.  A flat floor pan is born at the law floor
      (``grade_law.tunnel_trench_floor_elevation_m`` = datum − body depth −
      ``TUNNEL_FLOOR_BELOW_OBJECT_DECK_M``), and a rim band is born at the
      datum (``grade_law.tunnel_trench_rim_elevation_m``) — the two rows a
      node-split apart form the near-vertical R2 wall.
    * **FLUSH WALLS** (user screenshots 2026-07-18c): the floor pan covers
      the body footprint TO ITS EDGE, and the datum rim band sits OUTSIDE
      the body (``_TUNNEL_WALL_SETBACK_M`` .. + ``_TUNNEL_RIM_BAND_WIDTH_M``)
      — so the unavoidable mesh batter (two node rows can never share an
      x,y) leans OUTWARD from the shell and the terrain never pokes through
      the object's own vertical walls.  The previous inside-the-body
      collar + 1.2 m floor inset left the wall base protruding up to
      1.2 m INTO the shell.  Where the body abuts airside pavement the
      wall top is the pavement edge itself (the outward band yields to
      every already-born shape) and the floor keeps a
      ``_TUNNEL_FLOOR_OWNED_CLEARANCE_M`` bucket-safe clearance from
      every earlier-born shape.
    * **PAVEMENT WINS** (rulings R2/R8): the airside pavement union is
      subtracted from the body before birth and the yielded area is logged.

    Both plates carry ``layout.ROLE_TUNNEL_TRENCH`` — a flat-by-law terrain
    role wired (decimation exemption, weld LAW tier, per-node ``alt_abs`` at
    ``to_osm``, no within-shape grade rule) exactly like the bridge plates
    with ONE deliberate difference: it is OFF-PAVEMENT terrain (R2 subtracts
    the airside pavement from the body before birth), so it is NOT a
    pavement solver member (absent from ``PAVEMENT_ROLES``) and is born with
    ``record_pins=False``.  That keeps the deep floor from dragging adjacent
    airside pavement through the one-solve while the flat-by-law per-node
    ``alt_abs`` still cuts the trench and wins the LAW-tier weld at any
    shared vertex.  Returns ``(floor_plate_count, rim_plate_count)``; all
    zeros when the gate is off or no tunnel classified."""
