"""Recognize tunnel and taxiway-bridge structures from placed OBJ8 geometry.

Workstream W-R3 of ``docs/object_terrain_features_spec.md`` (section 3.1).
This is the shared, PURE classifier that feeds the two gated terrain
features: feature A (tunnel cutouts, W-T) and feature B (bridge
adaptation, W-B).  Geometry and placements in, records out — no file
discovery, no ``DSFTool`` invocation, no mesh sampling.  Callers hand it
already-read placements (``obj8_reader.read_dsf_object_placements``) and
already-loaded geometry (``obj8_reader.load_object_file``).

The physics the recognizers rest on
-----------------------------------
X-Plane places each object rigidly at ``terrain(anchor) + offset``, where
``offset`` is 0 for a plain ``OBJECT``, the signed above-ground metres for
``OBJECT_AGL`` and (absolute, handled separately) for ``OBJECT_MSL``.  A
structure's parts share (very nearly) one anchor terrain, so the classifier
reasons about height in an anchor-independent **effective height**::

    effective_y = placement.above_ground_level_metres + authored_local_y

which drops the unknown, shared ``terrain(anchor)`` constant.  The plane
``effective_y = 0`` is grade.  This is what lets a below-grade tunnel
authored 0..+7 and placed at ``OBJECT_AGL -7`` (EGLL tunnels 6/7/10) be
read on the same footing as a plain tunnel authored 0..-5 and placed at 0:
both have their roof slab at ``effective_y ≈ 0`` and their deck well below
it (spec section 2.1).

The world frame
---------------
All polygons and lines in the emitted records live in ONE per-structure
metre frame, following ``object_anchor``'s convention: an unrotated
east-north-up frame whose origin is the mean of the structure's placement
longitudes/latitudes (a synthetic heading-0 placement at that origin).
Shapely coordinates are ``(x, z)`` = ``(metres east, metres south)`` — so
polygon ``.area`` is already in square metres — and the vertical axis is
``effective_y``.  Convert a frame polygon back to longitude/latitude with
:func:`frame_polygon_to_longitude_latitude` (or a point with
``obj8_reader.local_offset_to_lonlat(origin_latitude, origin_longitude,
0.0, x, z)``).  Every record carries ``frame_origin_longitude_latitude``
so downstream code can make that conversion; this field is additive to the
spec's record sketch, which lists the geometry without saying how to place
it in the world — it cannot be omitted without making the polygons
unusable.

Up-facing, and why winding is not trusted
-----------------------------------------
The EGLL investigation found triangle-winding normals unreliable — flipped
in the deck objects — so the probe code classified faces with the STORED
vertex normals.  ``ObjectGeometry`` (frozen contract) does not carry stored
normals, and the supervisor-granted loader extension was for hardness only,
not normals.  The classifier therefore uses the one face signal that is
INDEPENDENT of winding sign: near-horizontality, ``|n_y| / |n| ≥
NEAR_HORIZONTAL_NORMAL_Y_MIN``.  A winding flip negates every normal
component, leaving that ratio unchanged.  Roof, deck and ceiling are then
separated by their effective height, which needs no normal sign — a roof
slab and its ceiling underside share a footprint, so the covered roof
footprint (roof ∩ deck) and the open mouths (deck − roof) come out right
regardless of which way any single face is wound.

Grouping
--------
A tunnel's shell and deck arrive as separate resources sharing one anchor
area (EGLL ``N.obj`` / ``Na.obj``); a KBNA bridge is six parts on one
shared anchor.  Grouping reuses ``object_anchor.discover_object_pools`` —
the existing world-footprint overlap primitive — so no new gap heuristic is
invented (spec pre-reading, ``docs/obj8_structure_partition.md``).  Parts of
one bridge or tunnel share a footprint and overlap by many metres; distinct
structures are hundreds of metres apart, so the small expansion epsilon is
not sensitive.

    deck axis, matching ``deck_top_profile`` / ``deck_end_elevations_y_m``
    / ``abutment_reaches_grade`` order.

    ``deck_top_profile`` is the deck top's effective height sampled in
    :data:`BRIDGE_PROFILE_BIN_LENGTH_M` bins along the deck's long axis,
    as ``(along_axis_m, y_m)`` pairs from the start end (amendment A2 —
    flat KBNA decks give a constant profile; the KMCO crowned humps and
    sloped ramps give the full shape, ruling R9).

    **Deck extent — the official definition (supervisor ruling, 2026-07-09
    round 3):** the deck is the FULL drivable hard surface, so the profile
    ends where that surface reaches grade, ramps included (KMCO: 392/909 m
    with ends at 0.00, not the 328/820 m between-abutments span).  The pin
    semantics W-B consumes are "profile value at each pavement/terrain
    contact point": a surface whose ramps land at grade pins terrain AT
    grade at the tips, with per-vertex targets along the whole ramp —
    strictly more information than a between-abutments span, and the two
    definitions coincide where a deck has no ramps (KBNA).  Do not
    re-derive a trimmed span downstream.

    ``deck_end_elevations_y_m`` are the first and last profile values (the
    solver pin values at the deck tips); ``deck_top_y_m`` is the profile
    maximum (crest).

    ``ceiling_y_m`` is the LARGEST-area underside plane below the local
    deck top; ``clearance_underside_y_m`` is the LOWEST such plane above
    the opening — the value that limits corridor clearance (KBNA: slab
    underside +4.8 versus girder line +4.2; the corridor emitter needs
    +4.2).  Either is ``None`` when no underside plane was found.

    ``abutment_reaches_grade`` records, per end, whether solid geometry of
    ANY hardness reaches effective grade within
    :data:`ABUTMENT_GRADE_SEARCH_RADIUS_M` of that profile end.  A
    structure failing at either end is a piered viaduct and never becomes
    a ``BridgeStructure`` at all (it lands in
    :attr:`ClassificationResult.refusals`), so on any emitted record both
    entries are ``True``; the field is kept for the audit trail.

    ``deck_hardness`` says which OBJ8 attribute carries the drivable
    surface: :data:`DECK_HARDNESS_HARD_DECK` (genuine ``ATTR_hard_deck``,
    the ruling-R8 flush-seating case), :data:`DECK_HARDNESS_HARD` (plain

    When a deck mixes both hard kinds the dominant kind by face area wins.

    tunnel signal (the guarded AGL limb — see
    :data:`TUNNEL_AGL_MIN_BELOW_GRADE_DECK_AREA_M2`): single placement,
    offset at or below −:data:`TUNNEL_MIN_BELOW_GRADE_AGL_OFFSET_M`, real
    below-effective-grade horizontal deck area, and nothing standing more
    than :data:`TUNNEL_AGL_MAX_ABOVE_GRADE_HEIGHT_M` above grade (a shell
    lives below the grade plane; a buried BUILDING towers over it).

    THE ABOVE-GRADE CAP IS JUDGED ON THE WHOLE STRUCTURE (owner ruling
    2026-07-31, "all the bridges you highlighted are above ground
    bridges").  It used to be read per RESOURCE, and a multi-part
    structure could therefore be seeded by ONE low sub-object while the
    rest of it towered overhead: measured at OTHH, Bridge_01 (12
    resources, pool crest **+10.25 m**) and Bridge_04 (5 resources, crest
    +1.91 m) were each seeded by a single ``*_LOD0_002.obj`` and cut as
    tunnels — Bridge_01's trench then ran to −6.34 m and left its ramp
    floating above the hole.  A structure that crests ten metres over
    grade is not a below-grade shell, whatever one of its twelve parts
    looks like.  The pool-wide floor on below-grade deck area travels
    with it for the same reason (Bridge_04 carries 8 m² pool-wide against
    the 25 m² gate).

    A SINGLE-PLACEMENT structure is unaffected by the pool-wide reading —
    pool equals resource — so every one-object AGL tunnel (the EGLL 6/7/10
    shells, and the fixtures pinning them) reads as it did before it.

    THE HEIGHT CAP ALONE CANNOT CATCH A LOW BRIDGE.  Bridge_04 crests at
    +1.91 m, inside the 2.0 m cap, and its below-grade "deck" is the
    UNDERSIDE of an at-grade slab: 1,022 m² of near-horizontal face between
    −0.5 and −1.0 m, and 8.4 m² below −1.0 — slab thickness, not a floor.
    Deepening the below-grade floor to catch that was measured and
    REJECTED: at −2.0 m (the plan's candidate) EGLL Tunnel/7 falls to
    19.4 m², under the 25 m² gate, and stops being a tunnel.  The gate that
    separates them is the area standing clear ABOVE grade
    (:data:`TUNNEL_AGL_MAX_ABOVE_GRADE_DECK_AREA_M2`): Bridge_04 1,650.6 m²
    against Tunnel/7's 0.0 and Tunnel/10's 128.7."""

    Pure: nothing is read from disk here.  ``placements`` are the

    thin caller can pass every placement — a pool that matches no signature
    is simply ignored).  ``geometry_by_resource`` maps each placement's
    ``resource_path`` to its :class:`ObjectGeometry`.  Optional
    ``pavement_polygons_longitude_latitude`` (shapely polygons or ``(lon,
    lat)`` rings) drives the bridge terrain contract; ``mean_sea_level_
    placements`` (read upstream with ``include_object_msl=True``) supply
    absolute deck elevations.  ``pack_root`` is paired with each consumed
    resource in :attr:`ClassificationResult.exclusions` (ruling R4).

    Grouping reuses ``object_anchor.discover_object_pools``; each pool is
    tried as a tunnel first (below-grade signature) then as a bridge.

    ``split_level_terrain_enabled`` mirrors the spec section 3.4 gate
    (``config.OBJECT_SPLIT_LEVEL_TERRAIN``, default off): feature-C
    ground interfaces are always MEASURED and recorded, but their
    resources join the ruling-R4 exclusion list only when the
    split-level terrain adapter is actually on — R4 excludes structures
    whose terrain IS adapted to them, and with the adapter off none is
    (LSGG 2026-07-23: unconditional interface exclusions plus the
    anchor-family widening starved the Phase 2 y-bake of 265/266
    objects, terminal buildings included).

    Stock library assets (``lib/...`` virtual paths — see
    :func:`is_stock_library_resource`) are dropped up front: a catalogue
    object is never a pack-authored terrain shell, whatever its shape or
