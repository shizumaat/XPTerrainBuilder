"""OSM aeroway centerline extraction + splitting.

Builds the polyline graph that taxi-rect emission walks.  Reads the
``aeroway=taxiway`` ways out of the cached OSM tile, links short
fragments into per-ref polylines, simplifies via RDP, then splits
each polyline at:

* significant chart-level direction changes
* width-profile transitions where the underlying pavement narrows
  or widens
* same-ref endpoints that other centerlines bend toward
