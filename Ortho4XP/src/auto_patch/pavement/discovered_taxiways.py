"""Discover unreferenced taxiway centerlines from raw pavement geometry.

Small / remote airports (and the fringes of larger ones) have real taxiways
that carry NO apt.dat row-1201/1202 edge and NO OSM ``aeroway=taxiway`` way.
Such pavement otherwise dissolves into the all-pair junction/apron residue
(``pav_union − rects``), where a long thin lane becomes an all-pair surface
that cannot articulate as a travel path and is a grade liability.

This module extracts the **medial axis** (skeleton) of the lane-width pavement
and synthesises a centerline along each lane; the discovered centerlines
join the global-slice spine downstream exactly like a referenced taxiway
(the rect-era builder that consumed them was retired 2026-07-29).

Why a medial axis (not rectangle fitting): unreferenced lanes form a connected
*web*; fitting one rectangle per residue blob collapses the web into a single
low-fill shape.  The medial axis follows each lane individually, bends and all,
and splits naturally at junctions.

Method (shapely only — no scipy/skimage):
  1. Densify the pavement boundary and take its Voronoi diagram; the Voronoi
     edges interior to the polygon approximate the medial axis.
  2. Keep medial edges whose clearance to the boundary is in the taxiway
     half-width band (so apron cores, which have large clearance, drop out).
  3. Merge edges into polylines, prune short spurs, and keep lanes ≥ ``min_len``
     that a real centerline doesn't already cover.
