"""Curve-native spine v2, Phase 1 — the GLOBAL slice.

Instead of manufacturing straight taxi rects and slicing junctions out of
the residue, cut the REAL ``pav_union`` (already following every true
curve, fillet and width change) by the recognized curved centerlines in
ONE global polygonize arrangement.  Each resulting face is a grading cell
that carries a spine edge; because every face is born from the same
grid-snapped, re-noded arrangement, the faces share EXACT edges — so the
result is conformant (no T-junctions) by construction, with no per-junction
weld/repair pass.

This module is pure geometry (no elevations, no roles beyond a placeholder).
It is the production slicing path (the legacy rect pipeline and
its gate were retired 2026-07-29).  See
docs/curve_native_spine_v2_plan.md.
