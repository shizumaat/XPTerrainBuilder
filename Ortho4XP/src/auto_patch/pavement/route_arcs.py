"""V13 ROUTE-GRAPH + ARCS spine (user architecture ruling 2026-07-02).

The solver's anchors come from FEASIBLE ELEVATIONS, which come from
ACCURATE TAXI DISTANCES between runway intersections and buildings — so
the spine's first obligation is metric fidelity, and the apt.dat
1201/1202 taxi-route graph is the authoritative distance source (it is
what production builds the spine from).  Its one shortcoming is the
lack of curves: every junction turn and every bend is a hard corner,
which the grading cannot climb smoothly.

V13 keeps the route graph as-is — every straight segment, every true
distance — and adds ONLY the missing arcs, in the key spots the tracing
work identified:

* JUNCTION TURNS: every branch pair with a real deflection at every
  welded node — including T-junctions where a stem meets a through
  route's interior (the production route-END fillet pass misses those;
  planarizing first makes them ordinary nodes);
* BENDS inside chained routes (split at deflection vertices so the arc
  pass sees them as nodes);
* RUNWAY entries/exits: hooks/diagonal blends via the existing
  runway-turn machinery.

Arcs replace corners, so path lengths only shrink toward the real
aircraft path — never grow.  Radii: R90_BY_SIZE per the segment's ICAO
size letter, mirrored equal per junction, shrink-to-fit the pavement
(the full thru-runway pavement: routes cross runways freely).
