"""Ground-vehicle ``service_road`` network builder (session 47).

Builds a rect + junction network for ground-vehicle routes — apt.dat 1206
truck routes and OSM small roads — but ONLY where a route is a dedicated
strip OUTSIDE aircraft pavement.  Where a route instead crosses an
aircraft movement area (apron / taxiway / runway), nothing is emitted:
that surface's stricter aircraft grade rules already apply (per user
2026-05-24), and pavement is minted only where none exists, so existing
ribbons and aprons are never double-paved.

THE GRADE NUMBER IS ``config.SERVICE_ROAD_MAX_GRADE`` and nothing else
(``ROLE_GRADE_LIMITS`` maps both road roles to it).  This module states no
second number: the percentage this docstring used to quote, and the
different one grade_graph quoted, were both stale copies of a constant that
had since moved.

Most service roads have no apt.dat / DSF pavement polygon, so a standard
corridor width is synthesised (``config.SERVICE_ROAD_WIDTH_M``).  The
network mirrors the taxiway model: ``service_road`` rects along straight
runs (graded along their axis at the road cap) + ``service_junction`` fill
polygons at bends / intersections (all-direction, same cap).  Cars handle
steeper terrain than aircraft, so these also double as apron↔DEM
transition ramps.

SOURCE PRECEDENCE (owner ruling 2026-08-12b): apt.dat 1206 routes are
AUTHORITATIVE where present and OSM small roads complement them —
:func:`dedupe_service_sources` suppresses an OSM line that merely
re-spells a 1206 route, at CENTERLINE level, before anything is minted.

    # APRON-CONNECTOR exemption (user 2026-06-26): a 1206 truck route that CONNECTS
    # the apron to a groundside lot is an SVC road CONNECTOR and must be carved (and
    # cut at both mouths), even where the alongside-terminal guard would drop it as a
    # curb road — "curbside is just groundside, it doesn't need its own class; a
    # truck route that never touches the apron just stays groundside."  A route is a
    # connector iff it CROSSES WIDE aircraft pavement (the apron: a perpendicular
    # chord through pavement ≫ a road width); a pure off-apron curb/parking road
    # never does, so it still drops to groundside.  The exemption only affects narrow
    # samples the terminal guard would otherwise drop (wide samples still fail the
    # width test), so it is safe.
