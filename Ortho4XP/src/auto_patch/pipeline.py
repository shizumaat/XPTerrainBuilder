"""End-to-end orchestration of the airport pavement builder.

Sequences the phase-1 (geometry + role) and phase-2 (elevation)

* OSM tile + airport extraction.
* apt.dat selection (best-of-OSM vs custom-pack heuristics).
* Phase-1 construction → ``O4_Pavement_Rects``,
  ``O4_Pavement_Centerlines``, ``O4_Pavement_Stubs``,

    elevation pass runs at the end:
      * Single runway shapes are replaced with per-100m segmented
        runway rects produced by the legacy CIFP+DEM generator.
      * Taxi rects get ``altitude_high``/``altitude_low`` tags
        from DEM sampling at axis endpoints, anchored to the
        adjacent runway segment when within 30 m.
      * Terminal pads get ``altitude`` from the DEM at centroid.
      * Junctions, buildings, aprons are left un-elevated (X-Plane
        triangulator interpolates them from neighbouring shared
        vertices).

    Optional integration parameters (all default to ``None`` so
    standalone callers — ``tools/build_target_osm.py``, the test
    harness — work unchanged):

      * ``taxiway_data``: per-airport list from
        ``osm_aeroway.extract_taxiway_info``.  Threaded through to
        Pipeline's centerline-union helper so reclassification /
        downstream consumers can see OSM taxiway centerlines that
        didn't survive into rects.
      * ``tile_dem``: pre-loaded ``O4_DEM_Utils.DEM`` for the

        ``smooth_raster_over_airports``).  When supplied, the

        this DEM directly instead of calling

        loads in the tile-pipeline driver and keeps auto_patch's
        elevation field aligned with Ortho4XP's smoothed terrain.
      * ``airport_boundary``: optional pre-computed airport
        boundary (``dico_airports[icao]['boundary']`` from
        Ortho4XP's ``update_airport_boundaries``).  Currently
        reserved — the parameter is plumbed through but the
        boundary-shape emit still derives its outline from

    # exact runway width and the shoulder is a wide draped ``.lin``
    # border traced along the runway outline — the strip's declared
    # width states the shoulder width EXACTLY (width/2; 13/31's 24 m
    # border ⇒ 12 m, 02C/20C's 20 m ⇒ 10 m).  Rather than grow a new
    # widening mechanism, DECLARE the measurement into the apt.dat
    # coded-shoulder path below ("this runway HAS 12 m shoulders"):
    # the established block widens symmetrically, junctions cut at the
    # shoulder edge (the OMAA-proven model), downstream segmentation
    # reads the widened ``width_m``, and the extent pass skips the
    # runway via the coded skip-set update.  Shoulders are symmetric
    # even when the border evidence is one-sided — the other side's
    # shoulder band is simply covered by abutting taxiway/apron
    # ``.pol`` pavement (13/31's right edge), and cutting junctions at
    # the shoulder line there is exactly the coded-shoulder semantics.
    # NOTE: the runway-segmentation contact budget
    # (RUNWAY_SHOULDER_SEGMENT) ran BEFORE DSF ingest, so it cannot
    # see a border-derived code — inert at KBNA (zero row-110
    # contacts); revisit if a border-styled pack ships row-110
    # contact geometry.

    # (15 m/side against continuous flanking pavement), the emitted
    # rect lands on the author's true shoulder edge instead of eating
    # ~4 m of taxiway complex per side and shredding the junctions.

    # the value is > 100 the 100s/1000s digits give the shoulder width in
    # whole metres per side (e.g. HECA's 701 = surface 1 + 7 m, 724 =
    # surface 24 + 7 m); a value < 100 is a bare surface code with no
    # explicit width (X-Plane's own 3-5 m default scaling — we leave
    # those runways unwidened, e.g. SPJC 27/28, CYXY 1).  The shoulder
    # strip isn't in the row-100 width, so without accounting for it it
    # falls into the junction/apron residue as thin "wings" running along
    # the runway.  For each runway with an explicit shoulder width, widen
    # its rect symmetrically by that width per side (spec-driven, no
    # pavement analysis), keeping it a clean 4-corner rect.  Done here,
    # BEFORE the runway is subtracted from the pavement union below, so

    # segmentation (reads ``width_m``) builds sub-rects at the widened

    # RELOCATED POST-DSF (user ruling 2026-07-17: "segmentation
    # contacts definitely need to run after we've processed the DSF or
    # we could miss important things").  This block previously ran
    # before the DSF sweep on ``apt_only_pav_polys`` — at packs that
    # ship ALL their taxiway pavement as draped ``.pol`` (KBNA, KCLT)
    # it collected ZERO exit contacts and the runways segmented on
    # thresholds alone.  It now runs on the FULL pavement set (apt.dat
    # ⊕ DSF ⊕ admitted border strips) AFTER every shoulder-widening
    # pass, so contacts are measured against the final widened rect at
    # the true paved connection points.  Two consequences of the new
    # position: pavement polygons wholly INSIDE a runway's rect are
    # skipped (a segmented-runway pack draws the runway itself as ~95
    # short ``.pol`` pieces — their internal joints are not exit
    # contacts), and the RUNWAY_SHOULDER_SEGMENT coded-budget
    # extension is retired (the rect is already widened to the coded /
    # border-derived shoulder edge before contacts are collected;
    # extending the band again would double-reach past the shoulder
    # and catch parallel taxiways).
    # Walk each pavement polygon's exterior; collect
    # the vertices that sit within ``INTERSECTION_PROX_M`` of a
    # runway's 4-corner rect boundary AND project to a centerline
    # parameter strictly between 0 and 1 (not at the runway ends).
    # These t-values become segment seam corners during Phase 2's
    # runway segmentation, so chain corners (= the runway-union
    # exterior) align exactly with apt.dat-pavement boundaries.
    # Without this, the junction-widening pass has to bridge the
    # gap with boundary-trace waypoints — the alignment makes that
    # unnecessary.  Per user direction: dedup intersections within
    # 2 m centerline distance (a junction can span a 2 m gap
    # without needing a node there).
    #
    # Per user 2026-05-11: tolerance widened from 0.5 m to 3.0 m so
    # apt.dat pavement boundaries drawn slightly INSIDE the row-100
    # runway rect (1-2 m offsets are common — SPJC's row-110 stops
    # 1.75 m short of 16R/34L at the V1 throat) still register as
    # runway intersection points.  Without this, the segmenter
    # doesn't insert a seam corner at the chart-level pavement
    # transition, and the downstream junction-widening pass can't
    # share a vertex with the runway there — leaving a visible
    # 1-2 m sliver gap between every taxi-junction and the runway
    # boundary.  The runway segmenter projects each kept point onto
    # the centerline and emits the seam corner there; the actual
    # corner sits on the runway boundary (rect-perpendicular at
    # half-width) regardless of how far the source pavement vertex
    # was off-edge, so widening the tolerance just unlocks more
    # near-runway pavement landmarks as segmentation breakpoints
    # without distorting the segmenter's output geometry.
    #
    # Per user 2026-05-14: bumped 3.0 → 6.0 m to capture SPLP's
    # north-end pavement corners drawn ~5 m INSIDE the runway
    # rect.  At 3 m those corners were missed; the runway
    # segmenter put no seam there, and the apron junction between
    # the A stub and the runway had to span ~110 m of runway
    # boundary (segment 25's full length) without a shared-vertex
    # snap point — the junction's runway edge ran past the A-stub

    #   1. Cross-strip SEAM-STEP blend (2026-07-18, SPJC in-sim cliffs):
    #      strips from DIFFERENT emitters (adjacent-ground bands, gap-fill
    #      spines) grading off different hosts hold metre-scale value
    #      disagreements at near-adjacent — or exactly stacked — boundary
    #      vertices, emitting bare terrain cliffs (SPJC: 152 pairs, worst
    #      4.4 m over 1.26 m).  Must run at PIPELINE level over the
    #      COMPLETE strip population (the tearing seams are cross-family).
    #   2. Post-merge tear heal: the hard-merge consensus + the seam blend
    #      can mint sub-metre near-vertical pinches after the
    #      adjacent-ground emit's own final heal ran (that one sees only
    #      its own emit group, and earlier values).
    #   3. Stacked-conflict wall emission (owner ruling 2026-07-19: nodes
    #      are NEVER stacked — same spot ⇒ one merged node, one elevation;
    #      a genuine level change is horizontal wall geometry).  ``to_osm``
    #      hard-merges every coincident claim, so a strip vertex coincident
    #      with a designed-split authority corner (building pad, service
    #      road, groundside — non-donor classes) would be AVERAGED into it,
    #      bending the strip metres at one column.  Resolve those sites as
    #      geometry: retreat the strip edge and emit a retaining_wall face
    #      over the vacated band.
    # ORDER CONTRACT (2 before 3): a wall-retreated vertex is unshared by
    # the heal's tests, and healing after the retreat drops it, springing
    # the strip edge back across the already-emitted wall band (measured
    # CYXY: a 2.16 m² strip∩wall overlap, the zero-tolerance
    # self-overlap invariant).
    #
    # ★ SPEC reference-honesty-and-terracing §2b (owner plan 2026-07-30):
    # the unit used to run BEFORE the LATE final grade projection, so the
    # projection moved the host pavement AFTERWARDS and the strips never
    # re-reconciled — every legitimate pavement move minted a fresh
    # ``graded_strip ↔ adjacent_ground`` tear class (CYXY 0 → 6 under the
    # apron reference surface, HECA 7 → 23).  The spec's remedy is
    # REORDERING, not a second derivation (single-pass principle): the
    # unit MOVES to after the late projection so it reconciles the FINAL
    # pavement.  Gate ``O4_STRIP_RESOLVE_LAST`` (default on); OFF restores
    # the pre-spec position exactly, so gate-off is byte-identical.
    # STANDING (owner 2026-08-05, no gates): the strip reconcile unit
