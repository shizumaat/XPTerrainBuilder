"""Post-mesh stage: re-anchor DSF objects against the freshly built mesh.

Contract frozen by workstream W1 (``docs/dsf_object_integration_spec.md``
section 4-W7, as amended by A4/A5); implemented in workstream W7.

Phase 2 of the DSF object integration cannot run before the mesh exists —
the y offsets encode one specific built ``Data<tile>.mesh``.  The hook is
a single guarded call at the END of ``O4_Mesh_Utils.build_mesh`` (and
``sort_mesh``), not in ``build_all``'s callers: the GUI's per-step Mesh
button and Shift-click sort_mesh bypass ``build_all`` entirely, and an
out-of-band rebuild is exactly how the 1.19 m staleness incident happened
(amendment A4).  The mesh path comes from ``FNAMES.mesh_file(
tile.build_dir, ...)`` — never the ``Custom Scenery/zOrtho4XP_*`` symlink
the prototype hard-coded.

Inputs arrive via the worklist sidecar
``Patches/<lon lat>/o4_object_anchor_worklist.json``, written once per
tile by the driver's MAIN process (workers race, amendment A5) before the
rebuild-skip gate, carrying identification only::

    {"version": 1, "tile": "+35-081", "xplane_root": ...,
     "airports": [{"icao": ..., "dsf_path": ..., "dsf_mtime": ...,
                   "pack_root": ..., "xplane_root": ...}]}

Discovery (placements, pools, partition) happens here, post-mesh — the
geometry caches key on (path, mtime), so repeat builds are cheap and
there is no stale-groups special case.  A worklist ``dsf_mtime`` that
disagrees with disk is merely noted: discovery is authoritative, the
worklist is identification only (amendment A5), and the CURRENT DSF is
what discovery reads regardless.

Invariant I-4's enforcement point is HERE (amendment A13, item 2): a
resource with more than one terrain-draped ``OBJECT`` placement is
excluded from Phase 2 before any decision is built — a shared ``.obj``
file cannot carry per-placement offsets.  (Phase 1 ACCEPTS the same
resources: N placements are N buildings, invariant I-5.)

Reporting follows ``verification.verify_and_log``: runtime validators are
pure reporters; an exception here must NEVER fail the tile (the caller
wraps this in try/except, and the function additionally contains every
per-airport failure itself).  Console gets one summary line per airport;
full detail goes to verbosity level 2, plus the "restart X-Plane
(objects are cached)" reminder once per corrected pack.
