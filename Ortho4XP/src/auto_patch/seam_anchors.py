"""Insert seam vertices at integer lat/lon tile-boundary lines.

For each pavement shape whose polygon's exterior boundary crosses an
integer latitude or longitude line within the airport footprint, this
module:

  1. Inserts new ring vertices at the crossing points (deterministic
     from polygon geometry alone, independent of which tile is being
     built — both tile builds produce the same vertices).
  2. Converts sloped 4-corner rects to ``node_altitudes`` representation
     so each vertex (including seam crossings) carries its own altitude.
  3. Records the seam-vertex bucket keys in
     ``layout._seam_anchor_keys`` for the Phase-2 elevation solver to
     HARD-anchor against ``dem.alt_strict``.

Cross-tile parity: each tile build runs over the same pavement
geometry, finds the same cut lines, and inserts vertices at the same
(x, y) positions.  Phase-2 then samples the same SRTM pixel at each
seam vertex (SRTM .hgt overlap row), so all tile builds compute the
same altitude.  ``cut_layout_at_tile_boundaries`` then keeps only the
shape pieces falling in the current tile.

    ``cut_layout_at_tile_boundaries`` each tile build keeps only ITS
    pieces, so a shape walk computes different floors on the two sides of
    a seam (SPLP: the −77 build lifted a junction pin to 65.7 against a
    runway the −78 build had dropped, whose twin pin stayed at 62.4 — a
    3.3 m step across the 10 m gap).

    The profile floor is the MAX over sampled axis positions of
    ``profile(t) − SEAM_CLAMP_GRADE · distance(P, cross_section(t))``,
    with the runway's half-width credited (the profile value spans the
    full width).  The earlier nearest-axis-point-only floor guaranteed
    the pin within cap of ONE profile point but let the straight chord
    to a runway-welded node farther ALONG the axis read over cap — the
    L1-vs-L2 gap (SPLP 2026-07-05: junction seam pin 62.9 vs the
    runway-edge weld at 64.3, a both-hard 2.17 % pair no projection can
    fix).  With the cross-section distance the triangle inequality
    bounds the pin against EVERY point of the runway surface in both
    directions.  Shape walk remains as the fallback for pre-redistribute
    callers (``apply_seam_dem_anchors``) and refs with no CIFP state.

    ``alt_strict`` returns nodata (-32768) AT the tile edge (the seam sits on the
    DEM's coverage boundary), so the pin below was SKIPPED there — leaving the
    seam vertex unpinned at its solved apron/junction level on the tile whose edge
    the seam falls on, while the adjacent tile (seam in-bounds) pinned it: a
    cross-tile cliff (SPLP -77 left a seam apron at 74.7 vs -78's 72.3, DEM flat
    ~72.3).  The smoothed sampler interpolates a real value at the edge, so BOTH
