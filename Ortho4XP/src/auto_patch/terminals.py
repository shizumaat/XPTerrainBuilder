    buildings — the road/curbside frontage where access roads,
    drop-off lanes, and parking sit on pavement at a different
    elevation than the airside apron.  Returns a Polygon /
    MultiPolygon to subtract from ``pav_union`` so groundside
    pavement does NOT become an apron junction grade-clamped to
    the terminal altitude.

    Per user 2026-04-29: combines two airside / groundside
    indicators on each building edge:

      1. APRON ADJACENCY (approach 1).  If the apt.dat polygon
         abutting the edge is connected (touching, transitive)
         to a runway-bearing polygon — i.e. the pavement chain
         from this edge reaches the runway — it's airside.
         Implemented by passing ``apt_pavement_seeds`` and
         testing whether the probe area intersects the
         airside-reachable subset.
      2. OSM TAGS (approach 3).  ``aeroway`` features
         (apron / taxiway / taxi_lane / stand / runway / gate)
         within ``edge_classify_radius_m`` of an outward-edge
         probe → AIRSIDE.  ``highway`` road-class features
         (anything but footway / path / pedestrian / steps)
         within the same probe → GROUNDSIDE.

    An edge is GROUNDSIDE only when at least one groundside
    indicator fires AND no airside indicator does.  An edge with
    NEITHER indicator (most common at airports with sparse OSM
    coverage) defaults to airside (no subtraction) — the safer
    choice when the data can't tell us.  This is a HARD contract
    (owner report 2026-07-27): an "any-airside promotion" that
    turned UNKNOWN edges into groundside once one edge was airside
    stamped 100 m rectangles straight across the REAL apron at
    SPJC's new east terminal (~190 k m² of airside gone) and at
    HECA — absence of evidence is never groundside evidence.

    ``road_ways`` / ``road_nodes`` (optional) are the airport-region
    ROAD FEED (``layout.airport_road_network``): the extract-local
    ``ways`` list at default config carries no minor roads at all,
    so genuine curbside/drop-off edges often had no groundside
    indicator to fire.  Feed ways with a road-class ``highway`` tag
    join the groundside catalog exactly like extract ways — the
    positive evidence that replaces the deleted promotion.

    For each groundside edge a perpendicular outward rectangle
    (depth ``groundside_extent_m``, width = edge length) is added
    to the subtraction zone.  The result is the union of all such
    rectangles; subtracting it from ``pav_union`` keeps the
    airside apron intact while removing the curbside / drop-off
    pavement that should not grade-clamp to the building.

    Per user 2026-04-28: also recognize ``aeroway=hangar`` and
    ``aeroway=tower`` because OSM mappers at some airports
    (notably HECA Cairo) tag passenger-terminal-class buildings
    as hangars rather than terminals.  Functionally these are
    identical for the pavement-grading pipeline: flat, fixed-
    altitude structures on apron pavement that the surrounding
    apron should grade to.

    HANGAR_PADS (s81, user 2026-06-12): hangars are ALWAYS
    building pads, terminal-airports included — aprons weld to
    their edges and taxi centerlines stop at their footprints
    (the pipeline trims lanes at pad boundaries, which retires
    the original malformed-sloping-rect concern below).

    Guard against false positives (pre-s81, still governs
    ``aeroway=tower`` and gate-off hangars): hangar / tower are
    only used when the airport has NO ``aeroway=terminal``
    items.  At airports where mappers DID use
    ``aeroway=terminal`` (e.g. SPJC), the explicit terminals
    are authoritative and the hangar/tower buildings are likely
    actual hangars / towers that overlap pavement and would
    cause overlap-clip to malform sloping rects.

    Gate stands are small fingers extending perpendicular off a pier; the
    gaps between them give a terminal a noisy sawtooth boundary.  We fill
    those narrow gaps out to the tooth tips (flat edges) while leaving
    genuine open spaces untouched::

        closed = pad.close(R)      # dilate→erode: bridges EVERY gap up to 2R
        fill   = closed − pad      # all the area the close added
        wide   = fill.open(GATE)   # the WIDE fills — open courtyards/centres
        result = closed − wide     # keep only the narrow teeth-gaps filled

    ``R`` (``BUILDING_OUTLINE_FILL_R``) is how far the fill reaches to
    bridge a teeth gap; a gap WIDER than ``2×GATE``
    (``BUILDING_OUTLINE_FILL_GATE_M``) is reopened as a genuine open space
    (a U courtyard, the space between two piers, the open centre of a
    finger comb).  Because the wide fill is SUBTRACTED from the connected
    closed shape (rather than narrow fills being added back as fragments),
    the pad stays in ONE piece — no floating rinds, no severed spines.
    This supersedes the old plain morphological close, which could only
    bridge gaps ≤ ``2×r`` and so left HECA's sparse, wide-gapped stands as
    a sawtooth (or severed the pier spine when the radius was raised).

    Robust across topologies (U-terminals, blob+pier, bars, long
    buildings) with no limb decomposition; a MITRE join keeps STRAIGHT
    square edges.  No-op for a simple convex/solid footprint.  Applies to
    ALL building sources — OSM and DSF terminals alike.  Returns a LIST for
    API compatibility: a single connected piece in the normal case, but if
    the wide subtraction ever pinches the pad apart, each piece ≥
    ``BUILDING_CLOSE_MIN_PIECE_M2`` is returned.

    OSM TERMINAL-WAY AUTHORITY (owner 2026-08-09, OTHH bug report;
    docs/specs/osm-terminal-way-authority-spec.md).  **An OSM terminal
    way is the identity of its building.**  Where OSM and the DSF
    describe the same building the OSM way wins the FOOTPRINT and the
    DSF clusters under it are ABSORBED (not emitted as their own pads):

    1. every OSM terminal way handed in (already through
       ``_extract_osm_terminals``'s ≥ 100 m² filter) is KEPT, whole;
    2. a DSF cluster is ABSORBED when
       ``cluster ∩ way / cluster.area >= absorb_frac``
       (``DSF_CLUSTER_OSM_ABSORB_FRAC``, default 0.5) for ANY kept OSM
       way — majority-inside means the way already represents it;
    3. clusters overlapping no kept OSM way behave exactly as before.
       With ZERO OSM ways the output is the cluster list unchanged
       (the degeneracy gate: such an airport is bit-for-bit identical);
    3b. a SURVIVING cluster that still overlaps a kept way is CLIPPED by
       that way (spec §2.3b, v2 amendment): the way OWNS its footprint,
       so no emitted pad overlaps a kept way.  Remainders under
       ``DSF_MIN_BUILDING_AREA_M2`` drop; a MultiPolygon remainder emits
       its parts separately.  Measured motivation: the dominant battery
       pattern is a cluster several times LARGER than and CONTAINING the
       way (HECA −239 cluster/way 8.2, KCLT −1292 12.5) — un-clipped
       that is two overlapping pads at two altitudes.  The cluster's
       genuine outside extent (parking structure, canopy) is real and
       stays.

    This is the exact REVERSAL of the retired rule
    (``DSF_BUILDING_OSM_OVERLAP_FRAC`` = 0.2), which dropped an OSM way
    covered ≥ 20 % by the cluster union and let the swarm represent the
    building — OTHH's 151,543 m² Concourse C came out as 32 flat pads.

    Returns the combined seed list (surviving DSF clusters first, then
    the kept OSM ways), ready to flow through the existing terminal-pad
    pipeline.  A geometry error while testing or clipping a pair is read
    as "cannot prove absorption / cannot clip" and leaves the cluster
    standing unchanged — a fallback that never deletes a building.
