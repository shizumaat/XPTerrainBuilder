"""Cut shapes along integer lat/lon tile boundaries.

X-Plane / Ortho4XP renders each 1° × 1° lat-lon tile as a separate
DSF file.  A single shape that spans two tiles is awkwardly bisected
at the seam, producing visual artifacts.  Per user 2026-05-10: for
each integer lat or lon line passing through the airport's pavement
footprint, build a buffered line (``half_width_m`` each side, so a
10 m strip by default) and subtract it from every shape.  Shapes
that split into multiple pieces are replaced with separate
``BuiltShape`` entries; sloped 4-corner rects convert to per-vertex
``node_altitudes`` (cut pieces are non-rectangular and the legacy
``[H, L, L, H]`` 4-corner convention no longer applies).

The mechanism mirrors how the pavement builder clips runway shapes
out of ``pav_union`` — just at a different geometric target.  Ortho4XP
and X-Plane stitch the resulting tile seams together at render time.

    generates tile -13/-78, which includes SPLP because the

    shape count (positive when shapes split, negative when slivers
    fall below ``min_piece_area_m2`` and get dropped).

    ``skip_roles`` shapes are passed through UNTOUCHED — neither cut nor
    altitude-resampled.  Used by the POST-solve feature cut to freeze AIRSIDE
    pavement: it was already cut by the PRE-solve call and graded by the solver
    against the seam DEM anchors, so re-touching it here only clobbers those
    solved altitudes (the gapped airside edge grazes the cut buffer and triggers
    a spurious re-sample).  The single source of airside elevation truth is the
