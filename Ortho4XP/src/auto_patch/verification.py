"""Build-time verification of an emitted airport layout.

Single source of truth for the auto-patch invariant checks, shared by:

  * the PRODUCTION build — ``driver.generate_auto_patches`` calls
    :func:`verify_and_log` on every airport it builds for a tile; and
  * the DEV pytest gate — the baseline-airport tests call the same check
    functions and ``assert`` on them.

There is exactly ONE implementation of each check.  Thresholds are
UNIVERSAL — no per-airport exceptions.

Diagnostics: EVERY finding is an auto-patch BUG to be tracked down and
fixed by an engineer, NOT something the user can correct in the source
data (user ruling 2026-06-16).  So no finding is printed as ``[verify]``
chatter — ``verify_and_log`` appends them ALL to the per-tile verify
DEBUG log (``<patch_dir>/auto_patch_verify_debug.log``), each saying WHAT,
WHERE — the ``shapeID`` to open in the patch, a lat/lon, and (for
junctions/aprons) the taxiways that meet there, e.g. "junction [#375]
where taxiways A, M meet".

``shapeID`` == the shape's index in ``layout.shapes`` (the same value
``layout.to_osm`` writes as the ``shapeID`` tag), so a reported id maps
directly to the way in the emitted patch.

    The longitudinal profile of a runway lives on its two long edges — the two
    monotone runs of ring vertices that hug either side of the centerline.  The
    END-CAP edges (the flat cross-ends, an OBLIQUE tile-clipped cap that can be

    (the former single-poly reconstruction) fabricates a phantom jog near an
    oblique clipped end.

    Rails are separated by LATERAL offset from the centerline axis: a
    long-edge vertex sits near ``±half_width`` (one side), while a cap vertex
    sweeps ACROSS the centerline, so its |offset| is small.  Vertices with
    |lateral − mid| ≥ ½·half_width on the positive / negative side form the two
    rails; near-duplicate consecutive vertices (corner doublings, T-weld /
    crossing-vertex clusters) within ``coalesce_m`` are collapsed so a
    quantization-level step across two coincident corners cannot fabricate a
    huge grade.  Validation requires each rail to span ≥ 50 % of the ring's own

    FAA/EASA grade caps AND the vertical-curve rate-of-grade-change limit — the
    elevation solver (or a runway-flex MOVE) must never pull a runway out of
    compliance.

    Reconstruct each runway's longitudinal profile and check, per consecutive
    segment, the caps below.  A de-segmented single-poly ring is measured
    EDGE-AWARE: it is split into its two LONG-EDGE chains (the monotone runs of
    ring vertices hugging either side of the centerline) and each rail is
    checked independently with true 2D horizontal segment distances; the
    end-cap edges — the flat cross-ends, an OBLIQUE tile-clipped cap that can be
    longer than the runway is wide, and any densification vertices on those caps
    — are excluded, so they cannot fabricate a phantom jog (the earlier
    per-station cluster mixed both rails and jogged near an oblique clipped
    end).  A legacy segmented runway (one flat cross-end sample per sub-rect,
    ordered along the axis) and any ring whose chain split fails validation keep
    the station-sample reconstruction.  Checks:

      * longitudinal grade ≤ ``end_grade_cap`` inside the first/last
        ``RUNWAY_END_FRACTION`` of the length, ``RUNWAY_MAX_GRADE`` (1.5%)
        elsewhere; and (when ``check_curvature``)
      * grade change between consecutive segments ``|g_right − g_left| ≤
        RUNWAY_MAX_GRADE_CHANGE_PER_M · (L_left + L_right)/2`` — the FAA
        vertical-curve K-factor the runway solver's ``faa_rate_of_change_pass``
        enforces on the sample chain (a runway-flex move uses only the grade-cap
        constraints, so it can reintroduce a curvature violation — this catches
        that).

    ★ Owner ruling 2026-07-26 (``config.RUNWAY_SEAM_CUTBACK_DEM_ANCHORS``):
    "ALL nodes along the seam MUST be at exact DEM and anchored BEFORE the
    solve, then the solver can grade between them and its other anchors to
    maintain grade."  A segment whose BOTH ends sit on a tile-cut CUT-BACK
    line is therefore a TERRAIN reading, not a solver choice: it is excluded
    from the returned violations and published on
    ``layout._runway_seam_grade_steps`` (kind ``seam_dem_step``) instead.

    ``end_grade_cap`` defaults to ``RUNWAY_END_GRADE`` (0.8%); pass ``None`` for
    a uniform ``RUNWAY_MAX_GRADE`` cap (the only longitudinal limit the default
    profile currently enforces — the 0.8% end cap is opt-in and the
    vertical-curve smoothing is STATUS item D, so the strict defaults are RED
    until those land).  ``noise_m`` (0.10 m) absorbs altitude QUANTIZATION noise:
    runway altitudes EMIT rounded to 0.1 m, so a grade-change reconstructed from
    three quantized cross-end samples carries worst-case noise ~0.1·(1/Ll+1/Lr);
    a tighter floor (e.g. 0.05) flags sub-quantization grade-changes as phantom
    curvature kinks (HECA's 3 "1.1–1.3× kinks" were entirely emit-rounding noise
    — the unrounded solver profile is compliant).  Returns
    ``[(kind, ref, value, cap, "lat,lon"), …]`` worst-excess first; ``kind`` ∈
    {"grade", "curvature"}; ``value``/``cap`` are decimal grades (grade) or

    patches where emitted, pavement or natural DEM elsewhere) must stay
    inside the lawful corridor ``grade_law.runway_end_envelope`` — BOTH
    bounds, the longitudinal twin of ``check_adjacent_ground``:

    * FLOOR — within the governed length the surface must not drop below
      the runway-end-skirt law floor (FAA 0…−3 % in the first 61 m, −5 %
      beyond, grade-change rate-limited).  Past the governed length a drop
      is LAWFUL, so nothing out there is checked.  Reported as ``end_drop``
      (extended centreline) and ``end_drop_flank`` (blast-pad side edges).
    * CEILING — out to the RESA reach the surface must not rise above the
      5 % RESA ramp from the pavement-exit elevation (ICAO Annex 14
      §3.5.10).  Reported as ``end_rise``.

    The ceiling half was added 2026-07-24 (arc A1).  The skirt emitter is
    FILL-only by ruling (STATUS part 30e: "the RESA cut (Pass C)
    separately handles terrain that RISES"), and Pass C has not run since
    ``B4_FLIP_DEFAULTS`` gated ``emit_surface_clearance_cuts`` off on
    2026-07-15 — so between then and now nothing cut rising terrain beyond
    a runway end AND this reader could not see it.  A one-directional
    reader is how that regression stayed invisible; both directions now
    come from the one law function.

    The floor march follows the extended centreline; the ceiling march
    sweeps the whole ``runway_end_corridor_half_width_m`` corridor, since a
    RESA breach is typically an off-axis mound.  Both use the same anchor
    geometry, entry-grade window and governed length as the emitter —
    clearance/grade_law are the single source.  ``tolerance_m`` absorbs the
    emitter's obstruction trigger (1 m), emit rounding (0.1 m) and DEM
    interpolation.

    Pure reporter (verification-architecture ruling): returns
    ``[("end_drop"|"end_drop_flank"|"end_rise", "<desig>", metres_outside,
    tolerance_m, "lat,lon"), …]`` worst-first; empty when every end is
    lawful or when ``dem`` is None.  With the ``O4_RUNWAY_END_SKIRT`` /
    ``O4_RUNWAY_END_RESA`` gates off this reports what those emitters WOULD
    govern — the motivating defect — so fixture baselines can be captured
    before flipping either gate.

# ADJACENT-GROUND VALIDATOR — the emitter LOCKSTEP MIRRORS
#
# ``check_adjacent_ground`` keeps its OWN station march (it reads the DEM
# where the emitter reads-and-writes band geometry), so every per-station
# behaviour ``adjacent_ground._derive_shape_stations_and_bands`` applies
# must be mirrored HERE too.  The mandate is stated in
# ``grade_law.adjacent_ground_supported_depths``: the validator flags any
# un-covered corridor breach, so an emitter-only clamp would leave the
# clamped-away deep columns still breaching and mint findings.  Both
# readers therefore call the SAME law functions over the SAME station
# sequence.
#
# Five mirrors live in the helpers below, each reading the SAME config
# gate the emitter reads (so a flip moves both readers at once) and each
# structurally INERT with its gate off:
#
#   1. ``_adjacent_ground_station_caps`` — per-station FILL cap (arc A4,
#      ``STRIP_WIDTH_FROM_CENTERLINE_ENABLED``) and CUT cap (the OLS
#      handover, ``OLS_CUT_ENABLED``);
#   2. ``_adjacent_ground_stations`` — the A3 END-SKIP bench pin
#      (``ADJACENT_GROUND_END_PIN_ENABLED``) OR-ed into the seam pins;
#   3. ``_pocket_collar_ring_lines`` — the B1 pocket-collar exemption
#      (``POCKET_COLLAR_RINGS_ENABLED``);
#   4. ``_collared_pocket_zone_prep`` — the B1 collared-pocket STATION
#      STAND-DOWN (``POCKET_COLLAR_RINGS_ENABLED``), fed into
#      ``_adjacent_ground_stations``: frontage facing a pocket whose
#      collar rings emitted is the collar's ground, so the emitter builds
#      no band there and the validator must not flag the un-graded
#      columns beyond it.
#   5. RAY OCCLUSION (``BAND_RAY_OCCLUSION_ENABLED``, owner ruling
#      2026-07-25 "it should stop at pavement"): a lateral band's outward
#      reach is measured through FREE GROUND ONLY, so the emitter's march
#      terminates at the first pavement hit.  The transect scan below
#      terminates at the SAME distance — it calls the emitter's OWN
#      ``adjacent_ground._station_occlusion_limits`` over the SAME station
#      sequence against the geometry the emitter PUBLISHED at emit time
#      (``layout.adjacent_ground_occlusion``), so there is no second copy
#      of the law and no second copy of the pavement.  Without the mirror
#      the reader would keep marching past an occluding pavement and mint
#      should_cut / should_fill against ground the emitter lawfully
#      stopped short of.  Inert when nothing is published (this emitter
#      never ran, or the gate is off).
#   6. APRON WALL SCOPE (``APRON_WALL_SCOPE_ENABLED``, owner ruling
#      2026-07-25 "if it's open terrain just let the raw Ortho4XP dem
#      grade up to the apron edge"): APRON frontage with no built
#      pavement within ``APRON_WALL_PAVEMENT_ADJACENCY_M`` is UNGOVERNED
#      ON THE FILL SIDE — the emitter lays neither a shoulder band nor a
#      retaining wall there.  Mirrored by zeroing those stations' FILL
#      cap (the emitter nulls their fill reference — same effect,
#      expressed in this reader's own vocabulary), off the emitter's OWN
#      ``adjacent_ground.apron_wall_frontage_qualifier`` over an index of
#      PAVEMENT roles only — which the bands and walls do not belong to,
#      so this reader rebuilds the emitter's index exactly rather than
#      needing it published.  The CUT side is untouched: a wingtip
#      obstruction is still flagged wherever it stands.  Inert with the
#      gate off — and, as it happens, inert TODAY in either gate state:
#      the apron family's fill cap IS the 3 m shoulder, which is inside
#      this reader's 5 m station step, so no apron should_fill can be
#      minted at all (the SUB-STEP CAPS divergence documented in the raw
#      scan below, which only ever makes the reader flag LESS).  The
#      mirror is carried anyway so that a future change to either number
#      cannot silently start flagging the ground this ruling leaves
#      ungoverned (pinned in test_adjacent_ground_apron_wall.py).

    st_end_skip)``, all aligned per station:

      * ``st_ref`` — the station's pavement-edge altitude reference, or
        ``None`` when the emitter's ``_station_reference`` would SKIP it
        (END edge / covered outward probe / unknown edge altitudes);
      * ``st_flag`` — ``st_ref is not None``, i.e. the emitter's ``usable``;
      * ``st_seam`` — the continuation-seam pins the daylight law must not
        bench (``at_continuation_seam``), with the ARC A3 END PIN OR-ed in
        under ``ADJACENT_GROUND_END_PIN_ENABLED``;
      * ``st_end_skip`` — MIRROR 2: the emitter's ``end_skipped[i] =
        (reason == "end")``.  ``"end"`` is returned by
        ``_station_reference_ex`` iff the station's edge altitude is known
        AND the shape has a runway axis AND the outward normal is
        end-aligned (``abs(dot) > _RING_END_NORMAL_DOT``) — and, load-
        bearing, that test runs BEFORE the crossing-zone and static-probe
        tests, so a station whose outward probe is static-covered STILL
        reads ``"end"`` when its normal is end-aligned.  The dot test is
        the per-edge ``end_edge`` computed here once and reused (there is
        no second copy of it).

    ``collar_zone_prep`` — MIRROR 4: the PREPARED collared-pocket zone
    (``_collared_pocket_zone_prep``).  A station whose seed point OR
    outward probe falls inside it is skipped exactly as the emitter's
    ``"collared_pocket"`` reason skips it, so the frontage the collar
    stood the bands down over is not flagged should_fill/should_cut.
    ``None`` (default; nothing collared / gate off): no zone test —
    byte-identical.

    Corner FANS are omitted exactly as before: fan stations share the
    corner coordinate (distance 0), so they never change a non-fan
    station's supported depth, and the emitter suppresses fans across a
    SKIPPED flank — which is every runway END corner — so station
    adjacency agrees with the emitter wherever an end pin can fire.

    beside every terrain-facing airside pavement edge must stay inside the
    lawful corridor ``grade_law.adjacent_ground_envelope`` — the LATERAL
    generalization of the runway-end skirt reader, in lockstep with the
    ``adjacent_ground`` emitter (both consume the ONE law function).

    Marches perpendicular transects outward from every terrain-facing
    airside edge (runway / taxiway family / apron — the SAME scope, edge
    selection, END-edge skip and terrain-facing probe the emitter uses),
    and at each outward distance ``d`` reads the corridor
    ``(floor_offset, ceiling_offset)`` relative to the local pavement-edge
    altitude.  A station's rendered surface is:

      * EXEMPT when it is covered by the emitter's own static clip — any
        shape (INCLUDING the emitted ``graded_strip`` bands, so a lawfully
        graded column is exempt) buffered by the pavement gap — or lies
        outside the airport boundary.  This is byte-for-byte the emitter's
        clip (``adjacent_ground`` builds bands by differencing the same
        ``static_union.buffer(_PAVEMENT_GAP_M)`` and intersecting the
        boundary), so a covered / clamped column is never flagged.
      * otherwise OPEN GROUND rendered by the smoothed DEM.  It violates
        the law when the DEM sits BELOW a finite floor (zones 1-2 — a fill
        band was owed but not emitted; zone-3's ``None`` floor makes a
        cliff LAWFUL, never flagged — the boundary-bridge killer) or ABOVE
        a finite ceiling (a cut band was owed but not emitted) by more
        than ``tolerance_m`` — AND lies WITHIN the daylight-supported depth.

    DAYLIGHT slope-limit lockstep (``grade_law.adjacent_ground_supported_depths``,
    user 2026-07-09): the emitter marches each station outward independently,
    then CLAMPS the per-station daylight depths so the daylight line benches
    along the frontage (an isolated deep ray no neighbour corroborates is
    clamped to a shallow bench, not a knife-slot blade — CYXY 417).  A column
    BEYOND that supported depth is therefore not the emitter's to grade, so
    the validator EXEMPTS it (flagging it would mint findings against the
    emitter's own lawful clamp).  This reader reproduces the emitter's raw
    outward scan per station (breach beyond the emitter's
    ``CLEARANCE_OBSTRUCTION_THRESHOLD_M`` trigger, one step out), applies the
    ONE law over the SAME station sequence, and flags only columns within the
    supported depth.

    ``tolerance_m`` (1.5 m) sits ABOVE the emitter's 1 m fill/cut trigger
    (``CLEARANCE_OBSTRUCTION_THRESHOLD_M``) so terrain the emitter
    deliberately left ungraded (deviation ≤ 1 m) is never flagged, plus
    emit rounding (0.1 m) and DEM interpolation.  ``step_m`` follows the
    emitter's / skirt's 5 m station convention.

    Pure reporter (verification-architecture ruling): returns
    ``[("should_fill"|"should_cut", "<ref>", metres_outside_corridor,
    tolerance_m, "lat,lon"), …]`` worst-first, ONE worst station per shape
    per kind; empty when ``dem`` is None or there is no airside pavement.
    With the ``O4_ADJACENT_GROUND_LAW`` gate OFF (no bands emitted) this
    reports the columns the law WOULD govern — the pre-flip baseline, like
    the skirt reader's off-gate behaviour.

    EMITTER LOCKSTEP MIRRORS (see the block comment above
    ``_adjacent_ground_stations``): the per-station FILL/CUT band caps
    (arc A4 + the OLS handover), the arc-A3 END-SKIP bench pin, and the
    arc-B1 pocket-collar exemption are all mirrored here from
    ``adjacent_ground._derive_shape_stations_and_bands``, reading the SAME
    gates and the SAME ``grade_law`` functions.  Every one of them is
    structurally inert with its gate off, so a gates-off run is
    byte-identical to the pre-mirror reader.

        KNOWN RESIDUAL (report to the lead, not fixable here): the

        16R/34L: 3617 m of pavement over a 3497 m axis).  Stations past
        the axis endpoints therefore measure a larger ``d_axis`` in the
        emitter (distance to the endpoint, not to the line) than they do
        here — measured SPJC 2026-07-25, the A4 fill cap runs 2.5-34.5 m
        off the apt axis vs 34.5-75.0 m off the midline.  The clean fix

    the two mean different things: a shape-to-shape row is emitted work to
    fix, a dem-to-dem row is ground the breach-trigger corridor deliberately
    left alone and which the LONGITUDINAL law says it should not have.

    ``groups`` — ``[(origin, axis_unit, length_m, half_width_m, cap)]`` per
    runway.  ``surface(x, y) -> (elev, is_pavement, source) | None`` is the
    RESULTING surface: an emitted shape's value where one covers the point
    (with ``is_pavement`` true for the pavement roles, whose own laws
    govern them), the DEM where none does, ``None`` where nothing can be
    read.  Pairs whose BOTH ends are pavement are skipped — that surface is
    the runway/taxiway's own longitudinal law, read by its own checks.

    * REFUSED islands — reported informationally as

      deeper than ``OLS_MAX_CUT_DEPTH_M`` by design (shaving a real
      mountain's fringe sculpts a moat), so flagging them would demand
      the impossible.
    * COVERED islands — an island whose deepest cell already lies under
      an emitted ``ROLE_OLS_CUT`` shape (or any other elevation-carrying
      shape) is governed; nothing to report.
    * The gate — with ``OLS_CUT_ENABLED`` off this reports what the
      emitter WOULD govern, so fixture baselines can be captured before
      the flip.  That is the same convention ``check_runway_end_skirt``
      uses and is why the reader is deliberately NOT gated.

    ``tolerance_m`` absorbs the emitter's obstruction trigger, emit
    rounding and DEM interpolation, exactly as the sibling readers do.

    Such a sliver is the KJQF/​part-30j regression class: where one shape
    RE-DERIVES a neighbour's outline with a slightly different vertex set,
    a foreign vertex lands ON the neighbour's edge WITHOUT a shared node.
    Triangle4XP's Ruppert encroachment rule then ping-pongs edge splits on
    the near-zero-area sliver down to machine epsilon, exploding the tile
    (KJQF: the boundary↔groundside_pavement seam alone drove ~2.0M tris).
    The FINAL epsilon-wedge weld in ``pipeline`` welds these; this check
    is the always-on regression tripwire so a future emitter that mints a
    fresh unwelded outline is flagged per-airport in the verify log.

    Operates on the in-memory layout (shapes share vertices by canonical
    coordinate, not an explicit node id, so vertices are grouped by a
    ``bucket_m`` XY bucket — the same tolerance the OSM emitter welds at).
