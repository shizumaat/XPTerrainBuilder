"""Typed events — the engine protocol's vocabulary (spec:
docs/specs/engine-protocol-multi-gui.md §5).

Every event is a frozen dataclass; views receive event OBJECTS in-process
and their ``dataclasses.asdict`` form over the JSON-lines transport, so
this module IS the protocol schema.  Compatibility rule: additive only —
new fields and new event types are minor protocol bumps; removing or
renaming anything is a new major version (negotiated via
:class:`EngineHello`).  Views must ignore unknown event types and fields.

``seq`` (monotonic per session) and ``ts`` (epoch seconds) are stamped by
the session at emission time, never by producers.
