"""JSON-lines standard-input/output transport for the engine session
(docs/specs/engine-protocol-multi-gui.md §5, Phase 2).

This is the subprocess View: a front end in any language launches
``Ortho4XP.py --engine-jsonl`` and speaks a line-oriented protocol over the
child's standard streams.

Wire format
-----------
* **Commands** (caller -> engine): one JSON object per input line,
  ``{"cmd": <name>, "id": <caller id>, ...named arguments}``.  The named
  arguments match the corresponding :class:`o4_engine.session.EngineSession`
  method parameters exactly (for example ``tile_info`` takes ``lat``,
  ``lon``, ``working_dir``); the transport calls the method with them as
  keyword arguments.
* **Events** (engine -> caller): every :class:`o4_engine.events.EngineEvent`
  the session emits is written as one JSON object per output line, its
  ``dataclasses`` fields plus an ``"event"`` key naming the type.
* **Replies** (engine -> caller): every command, whatever events it also
  triggers, produces exactly one ``{"reply": <id>, "ok": true/false, ...}``
  line so callers can await completion without heuristics.  A successful
  reply carries ``"result"`` (the command's return value, serialized); a
  failed one carries ``"error"`` (a human string).

Design notes
------------
* **stdout is the protocol; nothing else may touch it.**  The pipeline is
  full of ``print``/``vprint`` calls that would corrupt the stream, so
  :func:`serve` keeps a private handle to the real stdout for protocol
  writes and repoints ``sys.stdout`` at ``sys.stderr`` for its whole
  lifetime — pipeline prints stay visible on stderr but can never land in
  the middle of a JSON line.  ``stderr`` is reserved for that plus uncaught
  crash text, per the spec.
* **Thread-safe, line-buffered writes.**  Session subscriber callbacks fire
  on worker threads while the read loop blocks on stdin, so every protocol
  write (its ``json.dumps`` line and the flush) is serialized under one
  lock.
* **Tuple / non-JSON handling.**  ``dataclasses.asdict`` cannot serialize
  :class:`o4_engine.events.ScanBatch` because its ``built`` mapping is keyed
  by ``(lat, lon)`` tuples, which are not valid JSON object keys.  The
  schema (that event's docstring) says consumers index positionally, so
  :func:`serialize_event` special-cases ``ScanBatch`` into a list of
  ``[lat, lon, info]`` triples.  All other non-JSON values (dataclasses,
  tuples, enums, Python ``type`` objects in the settings registry) are made
  JSON-safe by :func:`_json_safe`, which stringifies anything it does not
  recognize rather than raise.

The transport itself owns the ``EngineHello`` handshake line: the session
emits its own hello during construction, before any subscriber exists, so
the transport writes the handshake as its deliberate first protocol line.
