"""Parallel tile builds: the phase-aware subprocess orchestrator
(docs/specs/parallel-tile-builds.md).

One :class:`ParallelBuildRun` drives a run in which up to N tiles build
concurrently, each inside its own worker child process running the
existing JSON-lines engine transport (``Ortho4XP.py --engine-jsonl``).

The parent dispatches ONE STEP AT A TIME (spec §3.8): every ``build``
command a child receives selects a single step key, so the parent knows
and controls each tile's phase.  Steps belong to resource classes; the
two NETWORK classes ("osm" for vector, "imagery") carry concurrency
caps so a forty-tile queue can never stampede the OpenStreetMap or
imagery servers, and the memory admission gate keeps concurrent mesh
steps within the machine's budget.  Compute concurrency is otherwise
uncapped — processor arbitration is the operating system's job
(2026-07-17 owner ruling).  A child whose next step's class is full
waits idle (a between-steps child holds almost nothing — the pipeline
communicates through files).  When capacity frees, blocked children
are dispatched finish-first (later steps before earlier ones, work in
progress drains before new tiles enter).

Children are reused across steps and tiles (one interpreter start-up
per slot), except after a mid-step cancel, where the child is retired
and a fresh one spawned so a red-flagged interpreter never carries
state forward.  The child's per-step ``BuildDone`` / ``TileState(done)``
/ ``RunDone`` events are consumed as scheduling signals; the parent
forwards tile-level terminals only when a tile's LAST step completes,
and remaps ``StepProgress`` percent from the child's single-step window
into the tile's full-plan window, so views see exactly the stream a
whole-tile build produced.

No GUI-toolkit imports (core-module rule).  The session owns run
lifecycle bookkeeping; this module reports back through
``session._emit`` and ``session._run_finished``.

    """Advisory wall-clock remaining estimate for a parallel run.

    Work model: every queued tile contributes its full predicted plan;
    every active tile contributes its remaining steps.  An in-flight
    step with a LIVE child report (``live_step_remaining``, harvested
    from the worker's own RunEta — bar rates, the auto-patch model and
    meter floors the parent cannot see) is priced at that report, aged
    by its own staleness; otherwise it is credited for its elapsed time
    (degrading into overrun-proportional remaining once it outlives its
    prediction — see :func:`tile_time_model.remaining_step_seconds`).
    The wall clock is a MAKESPAN, not a fluid: a tile is bound to one
    worker, so the run can never end before the longest single tile's
    own remaining chain (owner report 2026-07-28: tiles of 6 min and
    1 min on 2 slots showed "3 min" total — total-work ÷ slots underran
    the longest tile).  Per-tile remainders are packed longest-first
    onto ``slots`` workers (active tiles keep the worker they hold) and
    the estimate is the fullest worker's load — with every tile already
    running this reduces to max(per-tile remaining), exactly the
    per-tile clocks' longest row.  Still coarse (class limits and the
    memory gate are not modelled).  Returns ``None`` when no work
    remains.
