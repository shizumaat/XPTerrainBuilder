"""EngineSession — the Controller of the one-engine / many-views design
(docs/specs/engine-protocol-multi-gui.md).

Views (the Qt application, the JSON-lines transport, the command line)
invoke COMMANDS on a session and receive typed EVENTS (o4_engine.events)
through :meth:`EngineSession.subscribe`.  The session owns worker threads,
cancellation, whole-tile percent/label math, event batching cadence, and
the run clock estimate — so every view behaves identically and none can
flood a pipe.  Subscriber callbacks run on UNSPECIFIED worker threads;
marshaling onto a user-interface thread is the view's job (the Qt view
uses one QObject bridge with a single cross-thread Signal).

Core pipeline modules never import this package: they keep calling the
``O4_UI_Utils`` module functions, whose bodies route here through the
``O4_UI_Utils.engine_session`` attribute (set on session construction) —
no import cycle, and the legacy Tkinter application keeps working through
the old ``gui`` attribute when no session exists.

    * While auto-patch owns the vector step, the auto-patch time model's
      own per-airport ``eta_total_seconds`` (already blended against
      elapsed by that model) replaces the in-step extrapolation — the
      strongest signal available and previously discarded by the Qt view.
