"""Pytest configuration shared by all tests.

* Adds the project's ``src/`` directory to ``sys.path`` so tests can
  import the O4 modules directly without installing the package.
* Provides the airport-discovery + ship-mode toggle helpers used by
  the integration test suites (overlap, junction invariants, grade,
  geometry, …) so airports are not hard-coded in any test file.

Environment variables (per user 2026-04-30):
* ``O4_TEST_TILE=lat,lon`` — discover every airport whose runways
  fall in that 1°×1° tile via the project's CIFP scanner.  This
  matches "all airports in the tile being built".
* ``O4_TEST_AIRPORTS=ICAO1,ICAO2,…`` — explicit ICAO list, takes
  precedence over ``O4_TEST_TILE`` when both are set.
* ``O4_SHIP_MODE=1`` — skip every integration test (used at
  shipping time when tests should not run).  All test modules
  collect normally but each item is marked skip.
* ``XPLANE_ROOT`` — X-Plane install path used by every test that
  needs CIFP / DEM / apt.dat data.  Defaults to
  ``/Users/noah/X-Plane 12``.

When neither ``O4_TEST_TILE`` nor ``O4_TEST_AIRPORTS`` is set, the
discovery returns an empty list and parametrised integration tests
collect zero items.  This is intentional: the project should not
ship a hidden hard-coded list of canonical airports — every run
must be explicit about what it tests against.

    A full ``build_airport_pavement`` is the dominant cost of the suite
    (each airport ~30-60 s of geometry + elevation solve), and many
    test modules each need the SAME layout.  This single shared cache
    replaces the per-module ``_LAYOUT_CACHE`` dicts (and the modules
    that rebuilt per-test) so every (icao, params) combination is built
    AT MOST ONCE per worker process.  Combined with ``--dist loadgroup``
    + the per-airport ``xdist_group`` assigned in
    ``pytest_collection_modifyitems`` below, all of an airport's tests
    run on one worker → exactly one build per airport per run.

    The per-tile DEM is built INSIDE (so the cache key stays hashable) via
    ``_load_airport_dem(tile_center)`` — the SMOOTHED (apt_smoothing_pix=8)
    surface that production ships, the SAME one the grade test uses.
    Previously this used a RAW ``O4DEM(... fill_nodata='to zero')``, which
    produces a different surface (more terrain-extrema rect splits → e.g.
    SPLP 259 vs 250 shapes) than what X-Plane renders.  Unifying on the
    smoothed DEM makes every per-tile build (grade / compare_target /
    tile_cut) production-accurate AND identical for a given tile, so they
    all share ONE cached build per tile.

    NOTE: callers treat the returned layout as READ-ONLY — it is shared
    across every test for that airport.  Do not mutate it in place.
