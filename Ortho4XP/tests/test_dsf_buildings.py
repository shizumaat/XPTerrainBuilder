"""DSF building-facade reading + term_bridge grouping (20260614-02).

Covers:
* ``_building_role_for_def`` — terminal / hangar / bridge / None.
* the depth-5 facade bezier parse fix: a curved ``term_building_*.fac``
  is authored as ``(lon, lat, wall_param, ctrl_lon, ctrl_lat)`` per
  point; reading a fixed ``tok[3],tok[4]`` grabbed the wall param as the
  control lon (≈ a small integer), exploding the ring to continental
  scale.  The fix reads the LAST TWO planes, keeping the ring local.
* ``_cluster_dsf_building_facades`` connectors: a term_bridge joining two
  building footprints unions them into ONE pad; a bridge linking nothing
  is dropped; the no-connector path is unchanged.
