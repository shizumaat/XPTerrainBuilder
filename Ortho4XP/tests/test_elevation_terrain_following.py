"""Regression tests for terrain-following elevation (user 2026-05-02).

The elevation solver is the route-profile one-solve on the unified grade
graph (``elevation_per_surface/route_profile/``): runway/CIFP corners and
tile-seam pins are HARD anchors, and every other pavement node is bounded
by the REACH-BAND law — a cap-Dijkstra from the runway anchors over the
spine graph (``building_feasibility.reach_band_unified``), so a surface
may climb toward the terrain only as fast as its route's grade caps allow.

These tests assert the pipeline lets pavement FOLLOW the terrain up to
that law-given ceiling instead of collapsing everything toward the runway
elevation (the historic over-flattening failure mode).

See ``docs/elevation_solver.md`` for the solver reference.

NOTE: the within-shape grade law is NOT hand-rolled here — it is covered
by ``grade_graph_validate.within_violations`` consumers
(``test_pavement_grade.test_cyxy_spine_zero_no_bowl``,
``test_single_graph_acceptance``); an old all-pair Euclidean audit that
contradicted the law (and collected zero items) was deleted 2026-07-05.

# ── CYXY taxi E / SW apron — terrain follows DEM (user 2026-05-02) ─


def test_cyxy_taxi_e_south_apron_follows_terrain():
    """Taxi E at the south edge of CYXY's SW apron sits on natural
    terrain ~717 m (DEM truth).  The connected runway is at ~704 m
    (CIFP HARD).  The pavement must climb toward that terrain as far
    as the grade law allows — a collapse toward the runway elevation
    is the over-flattening failure mode this test guards.

    REQUIRED_M provenance (re-derived 2026-07-05): the historic
    714.0 m figure (user 2026-05-02) predates the REACH-BAND law —
    under the modern machinery no point may sit above its reach-band
    CEILING (cap-Dijkstra from the runway anchors over the unified
    spine graph, ``building_feasibility.reach_band_unified`` — the
    same band the solver seats against).  So the modern requirement
    is the LOWER of the two: the DEM-truth target 714 m, and the
    maximum band ceiling the law grants anywhere in the region.  If
    the band genuinely permits ≥ 714 m and the pavement still does
    not get there, this test is red honestly.
