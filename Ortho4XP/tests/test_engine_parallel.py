"""Scheduler tests for the parallel tile-build subprocess run
(docs/specs/parallel-tile-builds.md §3, §5).

These drive the REAL subprocess path of
``o4_engine.parallel.ParallelBuildRun`` against the pure-stdlib stub
worker in ``tests/fixtures/stub_engine_worker.py`` — no pipeline, no
network, no X-Plane install.  ``tile_worker_command`` is monkeypatched to
launch the stub, and the stub's script is chosen by tile COORDINATES, so
each test scripts the run through the tiles it builds:

* happy tiles (any lat not 60/61/62) complete done,
* ``lat == 60`` sleeps mid-build and honours a per-tile / global cancel,
* ``lat == 61`` fails its build,
* ``lat == 62`` crashes the worker mid-build.

The in-process cancel-semantics block at the end reuses the sequential
stub pipeline from ``test_engine_session`` (slots=1, no subprocess).
