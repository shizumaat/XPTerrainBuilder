"""Tests for the cross-process advisory cache lock (``src/O4_File_Lock.py``)
and its application around ``O4_Airport_Elevation_Insets.ensure_base_tile``
(``docs/specs/parallel-tile-builds.md`` section 3.5).

All headless: real ``multiprocessing`` workers for the cross-process
mutual-exclusion proof, in-process threads for the ``ensure_base_tile``
serialisation proof, and ``tmp_path`` for every lock file.  No network.

The synthetic-registry monkeypatch style of
``tests/test_elevation_level_providers.py`` is followed for the
``ensure_base_tile`` test: a fake base definition plus a one-entry
``ACCESS_STRATEGIES`` table whose ``ensure_tile`` observes concurrency.
