"""Flat-airport fast path — Tier 1 certificate coverage (WP1).

Hermetic unit tests (no fixtures, no network, ``tmp_path``-free) for the
taxi-rect and building-seat certificates added by
docs/specs/flat-airport-fast-path-spec.md §3.2:

  * a taxi RECT whose DEM is provably flat certifies (returns its seed +
    shortest axial span) and one over the axial budget / with a cross-fall /
    on a sampling gap refuses (``None``);
  * a building SEAT whose whole footprint DEM relief fits the seat tolerance
    certifies, SKIPS its reach band, and records the footprint DEM MEAN as the
    seated level through the same ``{id(shape): level}`` structure the band
    path fills — while a footprint over the relief budget, a tight reach band,
    or the gate turned off all fall back to the normal band clamp.

The certificate helpers sample the DEM through ``auto_patch.elevation.
_sample_dem`` (rects) / a caller-supplied ``dem_sampler`` (seats); both are
stubbed here so each case drives a controlled elevation field.
