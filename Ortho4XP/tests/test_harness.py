"""THE HARNESS TWINS — the assertions that keep the standard test harness
from drifting back into per-lane copies.

Every test here exists because a hand-written copy of harness machinery
produced a wrong number in this repo.  They are cheap (no build, no
X-Plane, no network) and they run in the normal suite.

* §1 THE CENSUS IS ONE CODE PATH — the family register covers every family
  ``run_checks`` emits, the recorded families PARTITION the returned lists,
  every law keyword is produced by the single sidecar reader, and the CLI
  has no private copy of that reader.
* §2 THE SIDECAR CONTRACT — every key the emitter writes is classified as
  either law input or evidence.  A newly emitted key that no reader
  consumes fails here instead of being silently dropped by every census.
* §3 THE BUILD ENTRY REFUSES — the wrong-cwd, missing-venv/OSM_data and
  no-sidecar paths raise loudly rather than degrading.
* §4 THE LANE RITUAL — the worktree script symlinks (never copies) the four
  shared data dirs, clones Patches, and refuses teardown while a child
  process holds the tree.
