"""Tests for the rigid-seat ground-span limit (design 2026-07-17).

A co-baked payware pack chains real buildings into airport-scale contact
components through connector objects (perimeter fences, parked-car texture
fields).  The Phase-2 y-bake sees each component as ONE rigid unit and
bakes a single vertical offset for it; when the terrain under the
component's ground-contact parts spans more than
``DSF_OBJECT_BAKE_MAX_GROUND_SPAN_M`` metres, one end floats or sinks past
the seating tolerance no matter where that single offset lands.  Such a
structure is left at its AUTHORED elevations instead (its real buildings
are carried by their own Phase-1 pads).

These tests are hermetic: synthetic geometry against a small hand-written
plane mesh in ``tmp_path`` (reusing the construction helpers and the
``plane_sampler`` fixture from :mod:`test_object_anchor`), plus a direct
exercise of :func:`auto_patch.object_rebake.apply`'s reversion pass
against a fake pack directory — no network, no X-Plane install.

        per-cluster law default ON (HECA skips 6386->41)"; design
        ``docs/specs/per-cluster-object-seating-spec.md`` section 4.3).

        This test was named
        ``test_high_span_chained_structure_is_left_at_authored_elevations``
        and asserted the STRUCTURE-wide span skip.  66a0a67 deliberately
        reversed that outcome — ``object_anchor._seat_clustered_structure``
        states it in the code: "a cluster over
        ``DSF_OBJECT_BAKE_MAX_GROUND_SPAN_M`` is no longer refused
        outright... refusing a real terminal zone and leaving it at
        authored elevations is the failure this whole spec exists to
        fix."  The rigid-seat span limit survives as a per-CLUSTER
        accumulation guard, so the same geometry now partitions into two
        clusters, each seated at its own median, with the elevated beam's
        residual REPORTED as a bridge seam rather than averaged across.

        Interventional check that the flip (and nothing else) is the
        cause: with ``O4_OBJECT_CLUSTER_SEATING=0`` the pre-66a0a67
        structure-wide skip reappears and the original assertions all
        hold — that arm is pinned in ``TestGroundSpanBakeLimitGateOff``
