"""Pad-in-solved-pavement HOST LEVEL re-level (user 2026-07-10, round 6 site 3).

A building pad embedded in / abutting SOLVED pavement must sit FLAT at the level
the HOST pavement solved to at the contact — not at a raw-DEM frontage seat that
leaves the flat pad in a pit the apron humps around (CYXY apron #129 →
building8: a -333 %/1.1 m step, "a big hump in this apron").

Synthetic fixture (no airport build): an apron edge solved at a body level, a
flat pad abutting it seated at a PIT value (below the body), and a run of shared
"lip" apron nodes contaminated to the pit value.  The re-level must:

  * seat the pad FLAT at the host BODY level (adopt FROM the host);
  * lift the contaminated shared lip to the body level (no emit cliff);
  * leave the host BODY untouched (pad adopts from host, never the reverse);
  * leave a pad already agreeing with its host, and a pad far from any solved
    pavement, UNCHANGED;
  * honour the ``O4_PAD_HOST_PAVEMENT_LEVEL`` gate (off → no-op).
