"""Geometry regression tests for the pavement builder.

Skipped automatically unless an X-Plane install is available (the
builder needs apt.dat + DSF + DEM tiles).  When run, builds each
test airport and asserts:

* **No self-overlap**: emitted pavement shapes must not overlap each
  other beyond a small tolerance.  Catches the SPJC regression where
  DSF visual overlays (e.g. ``zannespol/Asphalt_2_Green_T80.pol``
  with ``LAYER_GROUP taxiways +1``) duplicated the apt.dat row-110
  pavement coverage and produced 21 overlapping shape pairs covering
  ~15K m² of doubled area.
* **Coverage envelope**: total emitted pavement area must not exceed
  the source pavement (apt.dat row-110 ⊕ runway corners ⊕ surviving
  DSF) by more than a small fraction.  Catches the regression where
  a single DSF overlay polygon contributed 1.45M m² of "pavement"
  that wasn't pavement at all — bulk over-coverage of grass/decor
  areas.

Both checks would have caught the in-flight Phase 1 regression at
SPJC immediately.
