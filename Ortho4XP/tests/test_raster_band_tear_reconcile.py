"""Tier 3 wave 2b — adjacent-ground / raster-reach-band tear reconciliation.

When the reach band clamps an apron or
junction ~2 m down to its tighter, CORRECT ceiling, the adjacent-ground graded
strips bridging the resulting step used to emit a sub-metre near-vertical TEAR
(the ``check_grade`` adjacent-ground sentinel).  Two mechanisms reconcile it:

  1. ``adjacent_ground._heal_emitted_band_tears`` collapses a WITHIN-strip
     pinch (a host-weld row and a terrain row pinched sub-metre apart) by
     dropping the terrain-side vertex — the ruled ``_heal_band_tears`` doctrine
     applied to the final emitted rings.
  2. ``layout.to_osm``'s nid-level weld twins a soft strip-vs-strip seam node
     whose foreign value would tear the receiving strip, so each strip keeps
     its own value at the shared coordinate (the mesh still welds by
     coordinate — no Ruppert sliver).

These are hermetic unit tests (no X-Plane data, no network).
