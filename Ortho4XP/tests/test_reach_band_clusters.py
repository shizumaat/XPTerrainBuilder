"""Reach-band cluster amortization — Tier 3 wave 1 (``O4_REACH_BAND_CLUSTERS``).

Hermetic unit tests (no fixtures, no network) for the sound, byte-identical
serving-line sharing in ``building_feasibility.reach_band_unified`` and its
driver ``route_profile.anchors.node_bands``
(docs/specs/flat-airport-fast-path-spec.md Tier 3):

  * ``node_bands`` gate-off / no-``.batch`` inertness — the per-node scan runs
    and the result is byte-identical to the legacy list comprehension;
  * ``node_bands`` bucketing dispatch — the gate routes to ``band.batch`` and
    the returned list equals the per-node scan exactly (including the
    ``skip_from`` zone tail);
  * the batch is bit-identical to the per-node band on a controlled band whose
    value depends on the serving line, so a mis-shared line would show up;
  * ``_confirms_line`` is a SOUND sufficient condition (never a false positive):
    it only returns True when the candidate line is the point's nearest and its
    chord is on pavement, which is exactly when the nearest-visible scan returns
    it.

The reach-band internals are exercised through a small hand-built layout +
unified graph so the real ``reach_band_unified`` closure (its ``band`` and
``band.batch``) runs unmodified.
