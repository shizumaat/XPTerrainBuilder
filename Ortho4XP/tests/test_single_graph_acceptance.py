"""ACCEPTANCE GATE for the single-graph route-profile solver (user 2026-06-26).

For ~10 sessions "one graph" has been *claimed* done while the code kept TWO
graphs (a route graph that SETS elevations, a grade graph that CHECKS them,
bridged by ``geo_key`` with two context builders).  "Done" was judged by
eyeballing spine numbers — which a local bridge/hack can satisfy.

These tests make "done" OBJECTIVE and HACK-RESISTANT.  They must all pass, and
they are written so that a two-graph workaround CANNOT make them green:

  * ``test_cyxy_spine_zero`` — OUTCOME, and the load-bearing guard.  Zero spine
    violations on the strict extended validator.  This is what catches a setter
    on a different graph than the checker: whatever graph SETS the elevations, if
    the surface it produces doesn't satisfy the validator's graph, this is RED.
    RED today (18); GREEN only when the elevations the setter assigns satisfy the
    exact pairs the validator checks (= one graph in effect).
  * ``test_validator_detects_spine_step`` — ANTI-GAMING.  A known step injected
    on a spine vertex MUST be flagged, so the validator cannot be quietly
    weakened (looser cap, dropped pairs, inflated noise) to fake spine=0.

NOTE (2026-06-26): a ``test_solver_validator_same_spine_pairs`` was removed — it
compared ``spine_adjacency`` to the validator, but BOTH are derived from the same
``grade_graph``, so it was trivially green and proved nothing about the route
graph that actually sets the spine elevations.  False assurance is the exact
failure mode this file exists to prevent, so the outcome test is the guard.  A
genuine structural test must compare the ELEVATION-SETTING graph (the route
graph / the emitted z) to the validator — see STATUS.md.

RULE for the next session: do NOT add a bridge, a second graph, a ``geo_key``
mapping for emission, or a post-solve patch.  If you are writing any of those,
stop — that is the hack.  Make these tests green by unifying onto ONE node set,
ONE context builder, ONE runway-anchor rule (see STATUS.md / docs/
route_profile_solver_status.md).

    """LOCKSTEP (p5): with the anisotropic edge law ON, the SOLVER's unified-graph
    per-edge budget ``cap.at(Δs∥,Δs⊥)`` must equal the VALIDATOR's for every
    SHARED edge — not just the same node set.  Both go through one
    ``grade_graph.shape_constraints`` that bakes the route decomposition once, so a
    drift here would mean the build and the check disagree on the budget.

    RE-FOUNDING (2026-08-29).  The retired premise was the JOIN, not the law:
    the two sides used to be matched on ``round(coord, 2)`` coordinate pairs.
    The solver keys through ``G.pos``, which is LAST-WRITER-WINS across shapes
    sharing a canonical node, while the validator keys through each shape's OWN
    ring coords — and the canonical weld tolerance is far wider than 1 cm, so
    the SAME law edge could land under two different keys and min-aggregation
    read a phantom mismatch.  Measured on CYXY at HEAD: 57/28,780 shared keys
    "mismatched", ALL ``service_junction`` — 56 of them were key misalignments
    whose solver-side min budget existed BYTE-IDENTICAL on the validator side
    under a nearby key, and the 57th was a 5.2e-6 artifact on a ~3 m LIVE
    allowance, i.e. one law evaluated at two ``d`` values because each side
    measured the run in its own coordinate frame.  ``git bisect`` (probe = this
    test alone, both endpoints verified) puts first-bad at ``11c53b08``
    2026-08-12 "Corridor round follow-ups: the wall law reads the COURSE, and
    the minter reads the corridor set" — that commit changed CYXY's
    service-piece population, so the JOIN broke, not the law (parent
    ``6cb9396c`` green).

    The join is therefore now CANONICAL NODE IDENTITY (standing law: canonical
    identity join — never proximity-join): the validator's ring coords are
    resolved to solver node indices through the layout's canonical-point
    registry, exactly as ``test_solver_and_validator_same_nodes`` does, and
    BOTH sides measure ``d`` in the SAME frame (``G.pos``), so equality reduces
    to the law itself — (cL, cT, baked budget) — with no ruler left to differ."""
