"""ACCEPTANCE GATE for the single-graph route-profile solver (user 2026-06-26).

For ~10 sessions "one graph" has been *claimed* done while the code kept TWO
graphs (a route graph that SETS elevations, a grade graph that CHECKS them,
bridged by ``geo_key`` with two context builders).  "Done" was judged by
eyeballing spine numbers — which a local bridge/hack can satisfy.

These tests make "done" OBJECTIVE and HACK-RESISTANT.  They must all pass, and
they are written so that a two-graph workaround CANNOT make them green:

  * ``test_cyxy_spine_zero`` — OUTCOME, and the load-bearing guard.  Zero spine
    violations on the strict extended validator.  This is what catches a setter
    on a different graph than the checker: whatever graph SETS the elevations, if
    the surface it produces doesn't satisfy the validator's graph, this is RED.
    RED today (18); GREEN only when the elevations the setter assigns satisfy the
    exact pairs the validator checks (= one graph in effect).
  * ``test_validator_detects_spine_step`` — ANTI-GAMING.  A known step injected
    on a spine vertex MUST be flagged, so the validator cannot be quietly
    weakened (looser cap, dropped pairs, inflated noise) to fake spine=0.

NOTE (2026-06-26): a ``test_solver_validator_same_spine_pairs`` was removed — it
compared ``spine_adjacency`` to the validator, but BOTH are derived from the same
``grade_graph``, so it was trivially green and proved nothing about the route
graph that actually sets the spine elevations.  False assurance is the exact
failure mode this file exists to prevent, so the outcome test is the guard.  A
genuine structural test must compare the ELEVATION-SETTING graph (the route
graph / the emitted z) to the validator — see STATUS.md.

RULE for the next session: do NOT add a bridge, a second graph, a ``geo_key``
mapping for emission, or a post-solve patch.  If you are writing any of those,
stop — that is the hack.  Make these tests green by unifying onto ONE node set,
ONE context builder, ONE runway-anchor rule (see STATUS.md / docs/
route_profile_solver_status.md).
