"""Cross-tile elevation parity for the per-tile slicing pipeline.

A cross-tile airport (e.g. SPLP, which spans tiles -13/-77 and
-13/-78) gets processed once per tile Ortho4XP renders.  The driver
passes ``tile_dem`` (the current build tile's DEM) and
``current_tile_lat/lon``; ``cut_layout_at_tile_boundaries`` keeps
only shapes in the current tile.  For the resulting per-tile patches
to meet smoothly at the cut, the pre-slice elevation calculation
must produce consistent values at the boundary regardless of which
tile is currently being built.

Regression: a coord/DEM mismatch in ``pipeline.py`` and
``elevation.py`` (user 2026-05-12) caused ``_sample_dem`` to be
called with ``tile_lat = floor(layout.anchor)`` while the DEM was
the driver-provided current build tile — for cross-tile airports
where anchor and current build tile differ, ``_sample_dem`` indexed
the wrong row of the DEM array.  Fixed by routing
``current_tile_lat/lon`` through to ``_compute_elevations`` and
``per_surface_solve`` whenever a ``tile_dem`` override is provided.
