"""Tests for the DEM-cut tunnel-portal mode (user 2026-07-17, EGGW).

Two landed behaviours are exercised here, all headless (no network, no
X-Plane install, ``tmp_path`` only — nothing is written):

A. ``highway=unclassified`` joined ``bridges.HW_TUNNEL_TYPES`` so EGGW's
   airside service-road tunnel (``highway=unclassified tunnel=yes``) is
   seen by the portal emitter.  ``bridges._tunnelable`` recognises it.

B. DEM-CUT portal mode inside ``bridges._emit_tunnel_portals``: when the
   bare-earth DEM already carries the descending approach cut (a lidar
   inset sits ``>= TUNNEL_DEM_CUT_MIN_DROP_M`` below the airport surface
   over the first ``TUNNEL_DEM_CUT_WINDOW_M`` of every portal walk), the
   emitter drops the synthetic sloped-ramp chain and instead emits only
   the pieces the bare-earth model cannot supply — a flat ``tunnel_cap``
   at airport grade, a flat ``tunnel_mouth`` plate at the measured DEM
   road grade, and flat ``tunnel_roof`` plates over the covered bore.
   With a flat DEM (no cut) or with the mode gated off (``O4_TUNNEL_DEM_CUT
   =0``) the pre-change synthetic sloped ramps are emitted instead — the
   legacy path is regression-pinned here.

The scene is synthetic (a taxiway strip crossed by a ``tunnel=yes``
``unclassified`` way with approach roads at both ends); the road-layer
loader and the DEM sampler are monkeypatched so the test controls the
elevations exactly (mirrors the fixture idiom of
``tests/test_implied_tunnel_level_crossing.py`` and the
``bridges._sample_dem`` monkeypatch in ``tests/test_runway_end_skirt.py``).
