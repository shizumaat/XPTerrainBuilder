## Task

The arrangement clip preserves the airside vertex set (§16g (10) (12)) — then pads = clusters ship ON

## The brief

Founded on v2padqp r1–r2 (RULINGS 15z/15ah; §16g (10) (11) + (12)): the reason pads ship OFF is that the arrangement clip re-nodes the airside vertex set. Sites: `constraints/cluster_pad.py` (the clip; r2's `_base_ref` join + ref-area share stay), `classify/evidence.py` (the mint: "no longer pre-splits the outline at the apt.dat airside union when the arrangement clip is armed"), `planar/cluster.py` / `geom/cluster_outline.py` (the outline), `planar/overlay.py` (the arrangement — the airside cells must be computed before and frozen against the pad stage), `constraints/pads.py` (r2's one-way plate at airside pairs stays), `verify/census.py` + `tools/check_grade.py` (`pad_airside_renode`), `law/structures.toml`. Twins: `tests/auto_patch_v2/test_v2padcluster.py` (`_armed(law)`), `test_v2padlevel.py`. Measure with `v2_solve_replay --placement KEY=V` (the r2 capture arm). Other lanes running: v2shellwall (planar/structure_geometry.py, structures.py, constraints/taxi.py, structure_underpass.py), v2shoulderband r2 (classify/roles.py, rules.toml, runway_profile.py) — do not touch those files; the peer's v2channel (planar/channel*.py). Do not touch solve/design*.py. Never write the shared data repo or the X-Plane install; never --refresh-data; matched pairs on one tree.

## Bars

- Consumer census (08-30l) of every reader of the arrangement / airside cells / pad polygons / `_face_map` / the census cutters in the MEASURED block BEFORE the edit.
- `pad_airside_renode` family (airside vertices deleted or minted by the pad stage): HECA and LEMD OFF → ON arms = 0 (today: 1,082 deleted / 235 minted at HECA with the clip alone).
- Airside vertices moved > 0.02 m between the pads-OFF and pads-ON arms: HECA 5,973 → 0, LEMD 1,651 → 0 (survivors named with their rows); runway 189 / 43 → 0.
- `pad_airside_weld` OFF → ON: 0 new (HECA 8 → ≤ 8, LEMD 2 → ≤ 2); `pad_cluster_mismatch` HECA 0 (ref-area share), LEMD 1 named; the one-vertex probe (HECA stability frame) ≤ 0.02 m moved beyond 250 m.
- Owner site LEMD T4 garage 40.4892214,−3.5944287 on the ON arm: inside `building45`, one level, fill named, no short-edge step.
- Census pairs HECA + LEMD by family, no family worse by > 5 % unnamed.
- If every bar holds: `pad_from_cluster = true`, `pad_airside_clip = true` in `law/structures.toml`; else ship false with the numbers. Suite by FAILED lines; ONE LEMD airport-path build if the keys flip; `shared repo UNCHANGED`.

## Spec (design-surface) §20c

## §20c THE ONE-SIDED PROBLEM IS SOLVED AS A QP (Fable 2026-09-14; RULINGS 2026-09-14bw) — lane `v2qp`

MEASURED (lane v2settle r2, HECA): one 0.30 m ceiling row at one apron vertex
moves 959 vertices, 953 of them more than 500 m away — the damped active-set
fixed-point iteration (`splu` on the normal equations, lag rounds for the
one-way rows) exits `objective_stalled` on every solve and never reaches a
fixed point, so any perturbation lands on a different far field; a DEM-anchor
tie-break prices instead of choosing (weight-proportional) and is refuted.
1. The design problem — min Σ curvature (the smoothness objective as
   assembled) subject to hard EQUALITY rows, one-way INEQUALITY rows (§20a's
   `follows`), caps and DEM bounds — is a convex QP.  It is solved as one by
   HiGHS QP (`highspy`), the same solver §30 (3)/§32 (4)'s projections use.
   No lag rounds, no `follows` machinery, no damping: the optimum is unique
   (strictly convex objective) and locally stable.
2. `[design] solver = "fixed_point" | "qp"`: the old solver is kept behind
   the key for the matched pair and deleted when `qp` ships.
3. The certificate (§20a, `read_hard_failure`) reads the QP's own status:
   infeasible → the named infeasible set, never a traded row.
BARS: the one-vertex probe: moved vertices only within 250 m of the
perturbation (count named; today 959 with 953 beyond 500 m); every hard row
settled or named; the census by family at HECA/KCLT/CYXY/SPJC/OTHH before →
after with no family worse by > 5 % unexplained; solve wall ≤ 2× (named);
stage 1 / stage 2 of §20b both through the QP; the shipped patch diff named
(a converged solve differs by construction).

### §20c MEASURED (lane `v2qp`, branch `claude/v2qp` off main `63258868`)

**THE DIAGNOSIS IS CONFIRMED INTERVENTIONALLY, AND IT IS WORSE THAN
"UNSETTLED": THE SHIPPED SURFACE IS NOT THE MINIMUM OF ITS OWN
OBJECTIVE.**  F is convex, C¹ and piecewise quadratic, so accelerated
proximal gradient (FISTA with function restart) converges to its global
minimum from anywhere.  Run FROM the fixed point's own returned iterate on
the registered CYXY capture, with the one-way lag and the hard multipliers
FROZEN at what that solve returned — i.e. on exactly the problem it claims
to have solved — it drops F from **193 499.2357 to 190 618.15 in 9 s** and
moves **703 of 4 437 columns more than 0.02 m, worst 0.52 m**.  §20c's own
solver reaches **190 617.9104** (below FISTA's, from the other side), so
the two independent methods agree on the minimum and the fixed point stands
**1.489 % above it**.  A point that is not the minimum has no reason to be
stable, and that is 14bw's far field.

**§20c's SOLVER, AND THE DEVIATION (reported, not decided).**  The spec
names `highspy`'s QP.  MEASURED, in both textbook forms of this QP — the
epigraph form (a residual variable per row, diagonal Hessian) and the
normal-equation form (Hessian `A₀ᵀA₀` over the columns, L2 slacks for the
one-sided rows, L1-elastic slacks for the hard rows): HiGHS's QP is a
DENSE-NULLSPACE active-set solver.  It refuses at once — `ERROR: QP solver
has exceeded nullspace limit of 4000`, model status `Large nullspace`,
`Solve error` — because this problem's nullspace dimension IS its free
column count (4 437 at CYXY, 31 558 at HECA) and the limit's cost is
quadratic in it.  Raised to 200 000 it ran **630 s at CYXY without
terminating** (objective flat from ~230 s, nullspace dimension still
climbing) against the **3.2 s** solve it replaces.  The projections stay on
HiGHS because their QPs are small by construction (`project_runway`: 993
free columns at CYXY, nearly every row active); the whole-airport design
problem is not that shape.  What ships behind `solver = "qp"` is the SAME
convex QP solved exactly by the module's own linear algebra: the active
set's own subproblem PROXIMALLY damped (`min ‖A₀x−b₀‖² + Σ_active w(a·x−b̃)²
+ λ‖x−x_k‖²`, one extra diagonal block on the same stack, through the same
`_linear_solve`), λ ÷ 4 on an accepted step and × 6 on a rejected one.
`highspy` is imported at MODULE TOP in `solve/design_qp.py` and a twin
asserts it on the AST (memory `frozen-engine-lazy-imports`).

**WHY THE SHIPPED STEP FAILS, in one number.**  The fixed point takes the
UNDAMPED minimiser of the active set's subproblem and line-searches along
the ray from the previous iterate.  At CYXY that subproblem minimiser sits
at **F = 7.6e8** against F = 1.9e5 at the iterate it was taken from: the
ray is useless, the backtracking collapses to `_ALPHA_FLOOR`, and the
iteration exits `line_search_stalled` / `objective_stalled` — never
`same_set`, on every solve, exactly as 14bw measured.  Damping the
SUBPROBLEM instead of searching a ray out of it converges in **52
iterations / 94 linear solves / 1.2 s** at CYXY — LESS than the 3.2 s the
stalling iteration costs.

**THE ONE-VERTEX PROBE — THE BAR, MET.**  Matched pair on lane `v2settle`
r2's registered HECA stability frame (`scratchpad/v2settle/r2/heca.solved.pkl`,
base main `12400580`), the ONLY variable `[design] solver`; one extra 0.30 m
ceiling row at v9968 (30.12795521596, 31.4031429808), through
`v2_solve_replay --probe-site` (promoted there from `probe3.py`/`probe4.py`):

| arm | moved > 0.02 m | ≥ 100 m | ≥ 250 m | ≥ 500 m | worst | hard set under the probe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fixed_point` | **959** / 31 820 | 959 | 959 | **953** | 0.5206 m | 39 → 25 rows |
| `qp` | **0** | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0.0043 m** (whole field) | 18 → **18** |

The bar was "moved only within 250 m"; the QP moves nothing anywhere by
more than 4.3 mm — under the elevation materiality — and its hard set does
not change under the perturbation either.  The same capture solved twice is
BITWISE identical on both arms (sha `cef4f5c8a773` / `01c2f08e40b1`).

**THE AIRSIDE SOLVE SETTLES — the campaign's first-ranked standing debt
(13y (B) / 13ab / 14as, owner-ranked first at 12s) closes.**  §20b staged,
HECA, one tree, the only variable `solver`:

| arm | stage 1 (AIRSIDE) hard | worst | SETTLED | stage 1 wall | stage 2 hard | worst | total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fixed_point` | 35 / 174 500 | 0.0961 m | **no** | 87.6 s | 586 / 155 275 | 4.4203 m | 97.7 s |
| `qp` | **0** / 174 500 | **0.0200 m** | **YES** | 110.5 s | 572 / 155 275 | 4.4244 m | 119.8 s |

Stage 2 is the conforming side's own infeasibility (the pads) and is
unchanged; §20b (2)'s stage-2 substitution and both projections run on the
QP arm exactly as on the fixed point — ONE dispatch inside `_solve_stage`,
so the lag, the multiplier polish, both projections and every counter are
the same code on either arm.

**THE SINGLE SOLVE, three captures, matched replay pairs (`--emit` = the
build's own emit half; census by `harness/census.py`):**

| capture | wall | hard rows over 0.02 m | worst | lag worst leader | ADJUDICATED | law-true |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CYXY (`12400580`) | 3.2 → 4.2 s (**1.31×**) | 17 → **12** (6 an infeasible set, both arms) | 0.5627 → 0.5627 | 0.319 → **0.162 m** | 427 → **379** (−11.2 %) | 1 396 → 1 350 |
| HECA (`b1b7704c`) | 127.4 → 131.0 s (**1.03×**) | 39 → **18** (4 → 3 infeasible) | 1.2595 → 1.2595 | 0.709 → 0.708 m | 26 634 → **26 607** | 63 824 → 63 816 |
| KCLT (`b1b7704c`) | 67.8 → 82.1 s (**1.21×**) | 29 → **19** (certificate FEASIBLE both) | 0.1100 → 0.1099 | 0.300 → 0.302 m | 6 607 → **6 515** | 17 975 → 17 675 |

NO FAMILY IS WORSE BY MORE THAN 5 % anywhere.  The largest backward moves
are HECA `airside_no_step` 7 735 → 7 745 (+0.13 %) and `taxi_box` 3 397 →
3 404 (+0.21 %), KCLT `transverse` 327 → 331 (+1.2 %) and
`drainage_minimum` 1 461 → 1 465 (+0.27 %, version-deferred).  Forward:
CYXY `airside_no_step` 46 → 31, `taxi_box` 24 → 17, `road_cross_section`
18 → 13; KCLT `within_shape` 11 448 → 11 179, `airside_no_step` 874 → 850,
`strip_arc` 6 → 2; HECA `strip_transverse` 357 → 348, `transverse` 1 320 →
1 314, `strip_arc` 28 → 26, `pad_airside_weld` 3 → 2.  The runway
projection's own read improves at CYXY (worst hard row 0.0044 → 0.0002 m).
The shipped patch DIFFERS by construction — a converged solve is a
different surface — and the diff above is the naming §20c asks for.
SPJC and OTHH have NO registered capture, so their censuses are NOT
measured (the frames registry carries patches, not captures, for both).

**THE CLOSING BUILD** — `build_airport.py HECA --tag v2qpHECA` with
`[design] solver = "qp"`: rc 0, **449.1 s**, `body_sha 73b5bdecfd98`,
artifact ledger `2f4e1c4f8717`, status `optimal`, v2-verify 30 592 rows,
`shared repo UNCHANGED by this build (full-surface before/after snapshot)`.
Its design line reads `QP (§20c): 6 exact solve(s), optimal x6, 197
round(s) / 358 linear solves, 50.09 s, worst |grad| 537.7` and
`18/329337 hard rows violated (max violation 1.2595 m ... 3 of them are an
INFEASIBLE SET ... min total shortfall 3.1661 m)`; census law-true 61 845,
ADJUDICATED 26 348.

**WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE, AND IS OWED.**  (a) The LAG: §20c says "no lag
rounds, no `follows` machinery", and this lane kept both — the one-way
split is a bilevel relation, not a term of one convex QP, and removing it
means either pulling the pavement toward the ground it shapes (a two-way
penalty) or making ~15 700 soft rows hard (the §20a/13ac refutation).  The
lag is measurably better under an exact inner solve at CYXY (worst leader
move 0.319 → 0.162 m) and unmoved at HECA (0.709 → 0.708), still NOT
SETTLED on both.  (b) The HARD ROWS stay `hard_weight` penalties under a
2-round augmented-Lagrangian polish, not QP CONSTRAINTS: made constraints,
the QP is INFEASIBLE at CYXY on the first try (HiGHS presolve, 0.0 s) —
which is the certificate's own reading (6 CYXY rows are a proven infeasible
set, min total shortfall 1.5889 m), so the elastic treatment is the law's,
not a solver convenience.  What is left is NAMED on all three captures.
(c) `hard_worst` / `read_hard_failure` / both projections / `set_exits`
are untouched; `set_exits` is simply EMPTY on the QP arm and `qp_solves`
(status, rounds, linear solves, objective, |grad|, wall) is what replaces
it in `line()` and `as_dict()` — a nested value under the existing `design`
sidecar key, no `SIDECAR_KEYS` edit.

**SHIPPED OFF: `[design] solver = "fixed_point"`.**  Every bar in the
brief holds, and the lane does not flip the default for two reasons, both
for the spec author's ruling: the SOLVER IS A DEVIATION from §20c's text
(HiGHS, measured and refuted at this scale — above), and with the key
flipped the suite reads **2 failed, 1 563 passed** where the two failures
are this lane's own `test_the_shipped_default_is_the_fixed_point` and
`test_v2taxidatum::test_a_chain_touching_a_runway_keeps_the_contact`, whose
runway contact stands **0.24564 m** under its ridge against a bar of
`crown × |off| + hard_tol` = **0.245 m** — 0.6 mm over, an order under the
0.01 m elevation materiality, and the QP's surface is the one that
MINIMISES the objective those rows are priced into.  With the key at
`fixed_point` the suite is **1 565 passed / 1 skipped twice**, and the
flip is one `sed` on `law/emit.toml`.

### §20c RULED (Fable 2026-09-15; RULINGS 2026-09-15b) — the deviation is accepted; the damped proximal step IS the §20c solver; the key flips ON

(1) **The tool was the deviation, not the law.**  §20c's substance is
that the one-sided problem is solved TO ITS MINIMUM by a globally
convergent convex method with a certificate.  HiGHS's QP was named as
the instrument; it is REFUTED for this problem class by measurement (a
dense-nullspace active-set solver whose cost is quadratic in the free-
column count, `nullspace limit` at 4 000, 630 s without terminating at
200 000 on CYXY's 4 437 columns).  The proximally damped active-set
subproblem — `min ‖A₀x−b₀‖² + Σ_active w(a·x−b̃)² + λ‖x−x_k‖²` on the
same stack through the same `_linear_solve`, λ ÷ 4 accepted / × 6
rejected — solves the SAME convex problem and agrees with FISTA at its
minimum (190 617.91 vs 190 618.15 at CYXY).  It IS the §20c solver.
HiGHS stays on the projections, whose QPs are small by construction;
the module-top `highspy` import and its AST twin stay.

(2) **The lag stays; the hard rows stay penalties with the certificate.**
A one-way row is a bilevel relation, not a term of one convex objective;
folding it in means pulling the pavement or hardening ~15 700 soft rows
(refuted 13ac / 14au).  The hard rows as CONSTRAINTS make the QP
infeasible at CYXY — the certificate's own reading (6 rows, 1.5889 m);
the certificate names them, the penalty solves around them.

(3) **The key flips ON.**  `[design] solver = "qp"` ships.  The bars
held on every measured count: the one-vertex probe moves NOTHING by
more than 4.3 mm (fixed point: 959 vertices, 953 of them beyond 500 m);
stage 1 SETTLES at HECA (0 / 174 500 hard, worst 0.0200 m — the
campaign's first-ranked debt closes); hard rows CYXY 17 → 12, HECA 39 →
18, KCLT 29 → 19, every survivor named; adjudicated census CYXY −11.2 %,
HECA −0.1 %, KCLT −1.4 %, no family worse by > 5 %; wall 1.03× HECA /
1.21× KCLT / 1.31× CYXY against the 2× bar.  The two twins that read red
under the flip are re-founded, not weakened: the solver-default twin
asserts `"qp"`; `test_v2taxidatum::test_a_chain_touching_a_runway_keeps_
the_contact` reads 0.24564 m against a 0.245 m bar — 0.6 mm, under the
0.01 m elevation materiality (CLAUDE.md convergence guard (a)), so the
bar becomes 0.25 m with the residual quoted in the twin's docstring.

(4) **Release sequencing (owner's OTHH priority).**  App 1.0.340 carries
the merge OFF: its surfaces are those of 1.0.339 bar the DEFECT floor —
the LEMD tile closes on it.  The flip lands in 1.0.341 for the HECA pad
read; the certified OTHH customer build stays on the fixed-point
surface until the owner rebuilds it on a flipped app and reads it.

(5) **Residual, named.**  KCLT `transverse` +1.2 % and `drainage_minimum`
+0.27 %, HECA `taxi_box` +0.21 % — under the 5 % bar, carried into the
owner's read.  SPJC / OTHH unmeasured (no registered capture) — the
sweep at 1.0.341's build time is the measurement.  The stage-2 hard set
(586 → 572, worst 4.42 m) is the pads' own infeasibility (§16g (10) /
§30 (4)), untouched by the solver and the HECA pad line's next item.

## Spec (object-placement) §16g (10)

### §16g (10) (4)–(5) WHAT CHAINS, AND A DERIVED PAD NEVER TAKES AIRSIDE GROUND (Fable 2026-09-14; RULINGS 2026-09-14ah) — lane `v2padcluster`

MEASURED (lane r2, HECA): with pads derived from clusters as hard flat
regions, 502,561 m² of new pad (94,795 m² from apron) moved 13,637 of
21,534 airside vertices (runway 1,110, worst 4.38 m) and put the terminal at
+10.83 m; the T3 district stayed ONE cluster of 9,334 bodies / 541,200 m²
because its footed bodies genuinely touch through the authored ground
slabs.

4. WHAT CHAINS.  Only WALLED bodies link a cluster.  A thin body — floor
   slab, plate, deck, canopy, road, apron object; solid height <
   `chain_min_height_m` (2.5 m), or classed deck/plate/pavement by the
   object stage — is a LEAF: seated on its own ground or carrier, never a
   link between two walled bodies.
5. A DERIVED PAD NEVER TAKES AIRSIDE GROUND.  The pad polygon is the
   cluster's outline clipped by every airside face; a cluster wholly on
   airside pavement gets no pad.  A cluster whose outline is in more than
   one piece is SPLIT at the pieces (each a cluster with its own pad).

BARS: HECA airside vertices moved > 0.02 m = 0; the terminal at 30.1279552,
31.403143 at its pad 72.50; `pad_cluster_mismatch` 0; the T3 district
resolved into its buildings (count, largest cluster's area named);
constraints ≤ +10 %; KCLT BUILD with outlines — `building80` 221.44 ± 0.02
and the terminal's members' seats unchanged; SPJC 19.56 dry.

### §16g (10) (6) A PAD SHARING AN EDGE WITH AIRSIDE WELDS TO IT (owner RULINGS 2026-09-14ai) — lane `v2padcluster`

A `building` pad that shares an edge with an airside face takes the airside
face's solved level along that edge — no step — and its plane meets it
within the pad's own slope cap; the airside is the datum (airside is king),
the pad never pulls it.  A pad that cannot meet its airside edge within cap
is `pad_airside_weld` (CRITICAL), never a terrace step.  The cluster seated
on such a pad follows the welded level.  BAR: every airside-sharing pad at
HECA and KCLT welded (step along the shared edge ≤ `hard_tol_m`), named with
its airside face.

### §16g (10) (7)–(8) LEAVES GET NO PAD; A PAD BENDS TO THE AIRSIDE AT ITS RIM (Fable 2026-09-14; RULINGS 2026-09-14aj) — lane `v2padcluster`

MEASURED (r3): (4)/(5) hold, yet 345,016 m² of new hard-flat pad beside the
apron moved 17,482 airside vertices — a shared vertex is one unknown.  A
derived pad cannot be (a) one hard plane, (b) welded to the apron along its
rim and (c) forbidden to move the apron all at once.
7. A derived pad is minted for a WALLED cluster only; a leaf (slab, plate,
   deck, canopy, road; §16g (10) (4)) seats on its own ground and mints no
   pad.
8. (a) is dropped AT THE RIM: a pad is flat (cap 0) across its interior and
   non-airside rim; along an airside-sharing edge its rim vertices are
   one-way followers of the airside (airside leads), and the plate meets
   them within the pad's slope ceiling (1 %) — a bent skirt, never a step.
   Twins asserting a two-sided cap-0 plate at an airside edge are re-founded.
BARS: HECA airside moved 0; the terminal body on its walled cluster's pad
within 0.02 m, the pad within 1 % of the airside it touches, its cut/fill vs
the disarmed ground named; `pad_cluster_mismatch` 0; `pad_airside_weld` 0;
constraints ≤ +10 %; KCLT build at the final tree (the terminal pad's weld
named); SPJC build carrying heights (19.56 ± 0.02).

### §16g (10) (8) REFINED — RIGID CORE, ONE-WAY SKIRT (Fable 2026-09-14; RULINGS 2026-09-14al) — lane `v2padcluster`

MEASURED (r4): a whole-plate one-way form leaves the plate no rigid
relation and it collapses; a two-sided ceiling row on the airside-sharing
pairs holds the plate but still pulls 14,263 airside vertices (worst 4.55
m).  So: the pad's vertices farther than `pad_skirt_m` (25 m) from any
airside-sharing edge form a cap-0 RIGID CORE; the SKIRT BAND within
`pad_skirt_m` follows the airside ONE-WAY within the pad slope ceiling —
the airside leads and is never pulled; the core stays a plate.  BARS: HECA
airside moved > 0.02 m = 0; the terminal at its pad (72.60); `pad_airside_
weld` 0 or each named; KCLT `building80` weld re-read; SPJC viaduct re-read.

### §16g (10) (4)–(6) MEASURED, ROUND 3 (lane `v2padcluster`, 2026-09-14; branch `claude/v2padcluster`)

**WHAT CARRIES THE T3 CHAIN, MEASURED FIRST (the round's first order).**
Per body of the largest cluster (`unit:43`, 9,334 bodies / 9,333 touch
edges), how many cluster edges pass through it:

| resource | edges | parts | solid extent | `base_y` | area |

`black_glass.obj` contributes 366 bodies all at extent 0.00, and
`concrete_3.obj` is 13cs's 17,383 m² ground slab.  **The district is held
together by its floor and its ceiling**, exactly as 14ah read it.

**THE ARMS.**  DISARM `v2padclusterHECAdisarm` (`97a2267cfc28`, 462.1 s)
against LANE `v2padclusterHECA4` (`cbefb8edcacb`, 384.4 s, ledger
`72fb36419b42`), both `[guard] shared repo UNCHANGED`.  `v2padclusterHECA3`
is byte-identical in its design surface (same `body_sha`) — the object-
stage half of (4) moves no vertex, which is itself the proof that the
unit rule and the cluster rule are separable.

**(5) WORKS ON THE MAP AND NOT ON THE SOLVE, AND THAT IS THE ROUND'S
FINDING.**  Clipping the pads out of airside did what it says: the apron
GAINS 77,418 m² instead of losing 94,795, and no pad overlaps a runway or
a taxiway.  The airside still moves 17,482 vertices.  The mechanism is
not overlap — it is the WELD: 345,016 m² of new hard-flat pad now sits
BESIDE the apron along its whole perimeter, and a shared vertex is ONE
unknown (09-01g, contact = value), so the pad's flat rows and the apron's
own rows are peers at every boundary node.  Clipping moved the conflict
from the interior to the edge; it did not remove it.

**(6) AS A CONSTRAINT WAS ATTEMPTED TWICE AND BOTH FORMS ARE REFUTED BY
MEASUREMENT.**  14ai's sentence — "the airside is the datum, the pad
never pulls it" — has two implementations and this lane measured both:

1. WITHDRAW the shared vertices from the pad's flat plate.  The pad then
   has no plate at its rim and loses its own law: the §30 twin's pad
   tilted to **2.6 % against a 1 % HARD ceiling**, and a pad between two
   pavements half a percent apart stopped being flat.  Narrowing the
   withdrawal to the cap-0 target and leaving the 1 % ceiling the whole
   rim did not save it (4 ruled twins still red).
2. Make those rows ONE-WAY with the airside vertex as LEADER (09-10l's
   own shape, a new head in `one_way_rulings` + `pad_flat_rulings`).
   **13 ruled twins go red**, including the plate's own two-sidedness
   (§30 "every rim pair priced, contacts included") and §28's frontage
   direction.

Both are rewrites of laws this lane does not own, so NEITHER SHIPPED.
What shipped is (6)'s CENSUS — `pad_airside_weld`, CRITICAL, computed
from the patch by node identity — and it reads **16 pads at DISARM and 24
with the derived pads**.  The step ACROSS a welded edge is 0 by
construction and is not what it measures; what it measures is the pad
pulled out of plane at the edge, which is the thing the owner's sentence
forbids and which is now visible for the first time.

**THE CONFLICT, STATED ONCE.**  A derived pad is (a) one hard plane, (b)
welded to the apron along its whole rim, and (c) forbidden to move the
apron.  Any two of the three can hold; all three cannot, and the three
are §30's pad law, 09-01g's weld and 14ai's airside datum respectively.
**STOP-and-report: nothing further is armed.**  The lever the owner must
choose among: drop (a) for pads that share an airside edge (the pad
becomes a level, not a plane, at that edge — and its 1 % ceiling with
it); drop (b) (a derived pad stands OFF the apron by a declared joint,
§23, and shares no vertex); or drop (c) and accept a bounded airside
movement with a stated cap.

**KCLT, AND THE REF IS NOT A HANDLE.**  `v2padclusterKCLT3` (rc 0,
274.2 s, `d19ae4797bc4`, guard UNCHANGED; no ledger key — the tree moved
during the run).  Read BY COORDINATE at 13bo's own site (35.2191877,
−80.9426007), because `building{N}` is an ORDINAL and the derived pads
renumber every later one: the terminal pad is **221.46 → 220.56 m**
(−0.90), 865 → 483 vertices, spread 1.07 → 0.51.  The bar was unchanged
within `hard_tol_m`: **MISSED by 0.90 m**, and the members' seats follow
it.  `building80` as a REF now names a 16-vertex pad elsewhere — quoting
it across these arms would have reported 3.77 m of pure renumbering.

**SPJC IS INERT AND SAYS SO.**  The registered frame
(`SPJC_20260913T214930`) carries no `Part.height_m`, so (4) stands down
by its own clause and the units are byte-identical — 4 units, `fu:0:0`
with 484 bodies / 24 members including `xp11_007` and `xp11_010`.  The
19.56 viaduct is untouched BY CONSTRUCTION, not by measurement; an SPJC
build carrying heights is OWED, as is a KCLT one at the final tree.

### §16g (10) (7)–(8) MEASURED, ROUND 4 (lane `v2padcluster`, 2026-09-14; branch `claude/v2padcluster`)

**THE ARMS.**  DISARM `v2padclusterHECAdisarm` (`97a2267cfc28`) against
LANE `v2padclusterHECA5` (rc 0, 420.6 s, `1112755a1db9`, ledger
`85c18b3071e6`); KCLT `v2padclusterKCLT4` (rc 0, 259.0 s, `2fa924a012cc`,
ledger `dca6d7449633`); SPJC `v2padclusterSPJC4` (rc 0, 82.1 s,
`7f9b9659d13c`, no ledger — 23 external-candidate deltas in the window,
another lane's).  All four `[guard] shared repo UNCHANGED`.  Suite
**1,474 passed / 1 skipped, twice**.

**(7) LEAVES GET NO PAD, MEASURED.**  Of HECA's 1,380,739 m² of cluster
outline, **359,152 m² in 1,518 pads are LEAVES** (no walled body) and
**175,708 m² in 821 more are walled but under `cluster_pad_min_m2`** —
together **39 %** of the pad area that sat beside the apron.  The emitted
pad area falls 1,212,189 → **1,091,467 m²** (DISARM 867,173).  The same
population is used by `classify` (which mints) and by the census (which
judges), so the mismatch family can never report a cluster that was never
given a pad.

| bar | DISARM | round 3 | **round 4** | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **airside moved > 0.02 m (bar 0)** | — | 17,482 of 29,465, worst 12.15 m | **14,263 of 29,783, worst 4.55 m** | MISSED, worst −63 % |

| the terminal pad's CUT/FILL vs the DISARM ground | 72.07 | +8.87 | **+0.55 m of FILL**, cluster `fu:38:96@cluster_pad`, pad `building298` | named |
| `pad_cluster_mismatch` (bar 0) | 33 | 27 | **14** | MISSED |
| `pad_airside_weld` (bar 0) | **3** (worst 0.085 m) | — | **16** (worst 1.135 m, `building4 → pav1` over 51.5 m) | MISSED |
| constraints (bar ≤ +10 %) | 83.46 s | +55 % | **96.57 s, +15.7 %** | MISSED |
| law-true census total | 62,103 | 77,288 (+24 %) | **63,904 (+2.9 %)** | reported |

**WHERE THE CONSTRAINT COST GOES.**  `pad_flats` itself is 10.6 → **2.5
s** (the skirt prices fewer cap-0 pairs), and the LP is SMALLER than
round 3's (245,680 → 212,368 rows, 34,448 → 32,872 columns).  What
remains is the pad population: 823,018 → **838,816** `diffs`, i.e. 15,798
more difference rows over 1,091,467 m² of pad against 867,173.  The
residual +15.7 % is the price of the pads themselves, not of (8).

**(8)'s ONE-WAY CLAUSE IS REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT, AND ONLY THAT CLAUSE.**
14aj asks for the airside-sharing rim vertices to be ONE-WAY FOLLOWERS.
Built that way, a plate whose every binding is one-way has no rigid
relation to anything in the first lag round and does not chase back: the
§30 twin's pad collapsed from **703.56 to 640.89 m**.  09-10l's one-way
precedent is a LEVEL row — a mean against a leader band — which leaves
the PLATE holding the pad rigid; a whole plate one-way leaves nothing.
What shipped is the rest of (8): a pair with an end the pad shares with
airside is priced at the pad's own **slope ceiling** instead of the cap-0
flat target, so the pad is flat across its interior and its non-airside
rim and BENDS to meet the pavement it touches.  HECA: **8,967 skirt
rows**, 0 pairs dropped, **30 pads wholly inside pavement** kept their
two-sided plate (the OSM pad-in-an-apron class, which the skirt would
leave with no law at all).  That alone took the airside's worst move from
12.15 m to 4.55 m and the runway's from 3.14 to 0.41.

**THE TWINS, RE-FOUNDED AND NAMED (14aj's own instruction).**

| twin | asserted | now asserts |
|---|---|---|
| `test_constraints::test_strip_families_and_pads` | a cap-0 `Diff` over EVERY rim pair at `pad_flat` | the cap set is `{0, pad_slope_max}`; every ceiling-capped FLAT row has an airside end and every cap-0 row has none; the ceiling pass is still one row per pair over the whole rim (the ROW SET is unchanged) |
| `test_v2padlevel::test_a_pad_between_two_pavements_..._tiers_neither` | the pad's MEAN lies between its two frontages | the pad MEETS each frontage (a shared vertex IS that pavement's vertex, 09-01g) and its tilt stays inside the 1 % ceiling.  The bracket only ever held because a flat plate pinned at both edges must sit between them |
| `test_v2frontage::test_the_only_channel_left_is_the_two_way_apron_edge_ramp_law` | the two-way apron-edge ramp moves the pad < 0.05 m | the same claim, re-measured at **0.172 m**: a looser pad, the same channel, still downward, still the ramp's |
| `test_v2clusterpad` / `test_v2padcluster` fixtures | a cluster with no `walled` count | `_Cl` / `_Cluster` carry `walled`, because (7) drops a leaf |
| `verify.census.NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | — | gains `pad_cluster_mismatch` / `pad_airside_weld`: both are the CENSUS's and `verify` has no reader, so the lockstep twin must not expect one (CYXY v1 read 7 weld rows against v2's 0) |
| `test_v2padcluster::…pad_airside_weld…` | a least-squares plane residual against `hard_tol_m` | the SHARED vertex against its own pad's other vertices at `pad_slope_max·d`.  The first reading measured the bend (8) ALLOWS — HECA read 16 rows at DISARM and 36 with the skirt, the instrument counting the law working.  At the cap: DISARM **3**, LANE **16** |

**KCLT, AND THE −0.53 m IS THE WELD, NAMED.**  The terminal pad at
13bo's own coordinate (35.2191877, −80.9426007) is `building80`, 850
vertices, median **221.46 → 220.93** (round 3: 220.56), spread 1.07 →
**3.77**.  It shares **743 nodes with the apron `pav14`** (z 220.04 …
223.81) and 51 more with `pav118` — so the step across the weld is 0 by
construction and the pad's 3.77 m spread IS the apron's own fall across
the edge it is welded to.  The bar (unchanged within `hard_tol_m`) is
MISSED by 0.53 m and the movement is the weld's, which is what 14aj said
would make it lawful — **the owner's read is the acceptance.**  `pad_
airside_weld` 25 rows, worst `building80 → pav14` **1.384 m over 11.6 m**:
the pad could not reach that edge even bending at 1 %.

**SPJC, BUILT WITH HEIGHTS, AND THE VIADUCT MOVES.**  `xp11_007__b0` is
on pad `building7` at **20.07** in unit `fu:0:3@cluster_pad` of **6
members** — 13df's reading was **19.5604** in `fu:0:0@cluster_pad` of 24.
The leaf rule split the 24-member unit into 6 and the derived pad stands
0.51 m above it: **MISSED by 0.51 m**, and `building7` is also SPJC's
worst weld row (0.970 m over 20.0 m against `pav46`).

**THE SEVEN HECA BUILDINGS, AS FAR AS THE IDENTITIES REACH.**  A body
INDEX is as unstable as a pad ref — the cut renumbers bodies exactly as
the derived pads renumber `building{N}` — so only the bodies whose index
survived both arms can be quoted: `T3_38 b1` (14g's 160) `fu:43:7386@
cluster_pad` of 20 members on `building53` at 98.02, own ground **−6.70 →
+0.04 m** on `building160` in a 2-member unit; `T3_38 b4` (170) own
ground −0.02 → **−0.02**, WITHIN 0.3 both arms; `T3_38 b3` (147) median
ground 93.18 worst −2.45 → `building168` at 90.62, own ground −0.01,
worst **−0.33**.  `building_texture_4 b7/b8` and `building_texture_3
b29/b31` do not exist under those indices in either arm and were NOT
read.

**STOP-and-report.**  Three bars moved a long way (the terminal is MET,
the runway's worst move is 0.41 m, the cost is +15.7 %) and three are
still missed — airside 14,263, `pad_cluster_mismatch` 14,
`pad_airside_weld` 16.  The remaining airside movement is no longer the
pad pulling its own edge: it is the pad's SKIRT, bending at up to 1 %
over hundreds of metres, plus the 30 pads that keep a two-sided plate.
The lever the owner must choose among is now narrow: (i) a skirt WIDTH —
the bend is allowed only within N metres of the shared edge and the pad
is flat beyond it; (ii) the one-way form with a RIGID SEED (the plate
keeps a cap-0 core over its non-airside vertices and only the skirt band
follows), which is the form that did not collapse in the twin; or (iii)
accept a bounded airside movement with the 0.41 m runway figure as the
stated cap.

### §16g (10) (8) REFINED — MEASURED, ROUND 5 (lane `v2padcluster`, 2026-09-14; branch `claude/v2padcluster`)

**THREE ARMS, ONE TREE, LAW VALUES ONLY**, all against DISARM
`v2padclusterHECAdisarm`, all `[guard] shared repo UNCHANGED`:

| arm | `pad_skirt_m` | wall | `body_sha` | ledger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| round 4's scope (the shared vertices) | — | 420.6 s | `1112755a1db9` | `85c18b3071e6` |
| **the 25 m BAND** | 25.0 | 433.5 s | `ee7d0f56911c` | `b63e49fd65b0` |
| **SHIPPED** (band 0 = the shared vertices, + 14al's withdrawal) | 0.0 | 451.5 s | `18e51b7d084e` | `a602bba1b858` |

| bar | DISARM | r4 scope | 25 m BAND | **SHIPPED** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| airside moved > 0.02 m, of 21,523 (bar 0) | — | 10,048 | 10,683 | **9,573** |

| **the RUNWAY** | — | 1,021, worst 0.410 | 1,394, worst 0.570 | **885, worst 0.390** |
| `pad_airside_weld` (bar 0) | 3 (worst 0.085) | 16 (worst 1.135) | 21 (worst 2.42) | **29 (worst 1.135)** |
| `pad_cluster_mismatch` (bar 0) | 33 | 14 | 14 | **14** |
| law-true census | 62,103 | 63,904 | 66,771 | **64,844** |
| the terminal body on `building298` | — | 72.62, +0.08 m | 72.62, +0.00 m | **72.60, +0.07 m** |
| constraints (bar ≤ +20 %) | 83.46 s | 96.57 (+15.7 %) | 102.43 (+22.7 %) | **109.69 (+31.4 %)** |

**14al's ONE-WAY CLAUSE IS REFUTED FOR THE THIRD TIME, ON A THIRD
SCOPE.**  14al adds the cap-0 rigid core precisely so round 4's collapse
cannot recur, and it does not recur — with a core the pad holds.  It is
still not STABLE: built with the band following the airside one-way,
§28's own frontage row — which its twin proves moves NOTHING — moved the
pad **0.12 m**, and at CYXY the census and the engine's verify came apart
on `mid_edge_step` (**77 against 14**), i.e. the lag leaves residuals the
two readers do not share.  A one-way row is LAGGED; a pad bound to the
airside only by lagged rows has nothing holding it inside a round.
09-10l's precedent is ONE level row per pad against a leader band, with
the plate still rigid underneath — a whole band of them is a different
thing.  The band therefore ships TWO-SIDED at the pad's slope ceiling.

**AND THE 25 m WIDTH IS REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT TOO.**  It is WORSE on
every airside bar — airside 10,048 → 10,683, the runway 1,021 → 1,394 and
its worst 0.410 → 0.570 m, `pad_airside_weld` 16 → 21 and its worst 1.135
→ 2.42 m, law-true 63,904 → 66,771 — and buys only the terminal body
+0.08 → +0.00 m.  A wider band softens more of the pad, and a softer pad
moves more of the apron inside the same ceiling.  `pad_skirt_m` keeps
25.0 as its documented design value and **ships at 0**, which is NOT "no
skirt" but the airside-SHARED vertices alone.

**WHAT 14al DID BUY, AND IT IS THE BEST ARM.**  Its other half — WITHDRAW
the two-sided ceiling row over a pair of two airside-shared vertices —
is what the shipped arm adds to round 4, and it is worth **4,008 dropped
pairs**: airside 10,048 → **9,573**, the runway 1,021 → **885** and its
worst 0.410 → **0.390 m**, law-true 66,771 → 64,844.  The pad no longer
has any two-sided row between two vertices the airside already owns.
Counters published per build: `pad_flats.airside_skirt_rows` 4,959,
`both_skirt_dropped` 4,008, `pads_core_only` 74, `pads_wholly_in_the_band`
**30** — those 30 are the pads with no plate left (the OSM
pad-in-an-apron class), which keep their two-sided plate; at the 25 m
band that count is 55 and is the answer to "how many pads are skirt
only".

**THE 14 `pad_cluster_mismatch` ROWS, ATTRIBUTED — ONE CLASS.**  12
`cluster_spans_pads` + 2 `pad_spans_clusters`, and every one is the SAME
defect: **the cluster piece and the emitted pad ref are cut in different
places.**  The cluster is cut by `geom.cluster_outlines` (the closed
outline's connected components, then the airside clip — which is why the
ids carry `/k`: `unit:43#16/0`, `/1`, `/3`), and the pad ref is cut again
downstream by `classify/evidence._pads` (the runway difference, the
boundary gate, `min_area`, §22.2's skirt drop, and the separately-unioned
FALLBACK footprints, one of which landing inside a cluster piece splits
it).  `building19` is claimed by `unit:43#16/0` AND `/1` — two pieces of
ONE cluster over one pad, the two cutters disagreeing about where the cut
is.  TO REACH 0: a cluster piece must be minted as ONE part and never
re-cut — `_pads` must not subdivide it, and a fallback footprint landing
inside one must be absorbed rather than mint its own ref.  NOT ARMED
(the round's attempts are spent).

**THE COST, NAMED.**  Constraints 83.46 → **109.69 s (+31.4 %)**, over
the +20 % the round accepted.  It is not the skirt: `pad_flats` runs in
2.6 s and the LP is SMALLER than round 3's (222,546 rows against
245,680).  It is the PAD POPULATION — 823,018 → **830,023** `diffs` over
1,091,467 m² of derived pad against DISARM's 867,173 — plus the per-pad
band walk, which is O(rim × shared) per pad and is the one piece of this
round's own work in the number.

**KCLT AND SPJC STAND ON THEIR ROUND-4 FRAMES.**  The one-way skirt is
not in the shipped law, so nothing it would have changed there was built;
the two-sided withdrawal changes the design surface, so the KCLT weld
(the terminal pad 221.46 → 220.93, 743 nodes shared with apron `pav14`)
and the SPJC viaduct (20.07 on `building7` in a 6-member unit against
13df's 19.56) are as round 4 measured them and were NOT re-built this
round — **owed**.

### §16g (10) (8) AMENDED — THE SKIRT YIELDS, NEVER THE AIRSIDE (Fable 2026-09-14; RULINGS 2026-09-14au)

MEASURED (lane v2settle): with the airside fixed, 143 `building_pad airside
skirt` rows at KCLT (26.4 m of shortfall) and 1,428 conforming rows at HECA
under §20b are INFEASIBLE BY LAW — a welded pad's 1 % ceiling and a fixed
apron rim cannot both hold.  RULING: the pad's skirt band takes whatever
slope the weld requires up to `pad_skirt_max_slope` (5 %) — a slope, never a
step; the core stays a cap-0 plate; the airside never moves.  Beyond 5 % the
pad is `pad_airside_weld` (CRITICAL).  BAR: KCLT's 143 infeasible skirt rows
→ 0 with each pad's skirt slope named; HECA's certificate re-read.

### §16g (10) (9) A PAD BETWEEN APRONS SLOPES WITH THEM; THE BUILDING SEATS AT THE LOW SIDE (owner RULINGS 2026-09-14ay/az; supersedes (8))

1. A pad touching an apron takes the apron's level along the shared edge;
   the apron within `cluster_apron_reach_m` (40 m, re-armed, bounded to the
   touching component, never across a taxi-family face) joins the pad's
   plane (§30 (4)); no skirt.
2. A pad sharing edges with apron on more than one side is a plane sloping
   up to 1 % between them (the apron law's own cap — always feasible, since
   the aprons across that span hold it); the cluster's datum is the pad's
   LOWEST shared-edge level: nothing floats, the high side is buried by at
   most 1 % × the span.
3. `pad_airside_weld` (CRITICAL) fires only for a shared edge with a
   non-apron airside face that cannot be met.
BARS: KCLT 143 / HECA 124 infeasible skirt rows → 0 (each pad named: the
apron area flattened within the reach, or its slope and low-side seat);
the reach never crosses a taxiway; airside moved vs pads-OFF = the
flattened apron area only.

### §16g (10) (11) THE PAD COVERS EVERY SEATED MEMBER — RE-ARMED UNDER THE CONVERGED SOLVER (Fable 2026-09-15; RULINGS 2026-09-15h) — lane `v2padqp`

**The reading (LEMD 1.0.340, owner 15e item 2).**  The T4 garage
`LEMD_OBJ-Airport_Terminal4_green-PKT4.obj` b0 (H 12.5 m, bbox 667 × 118 m)
is seated by unit membership (`fu:25:983@cluster_pad`, 8 members) on pad
`building12` at 616.10, but that pad's POLYGON (way −10157) ends 55.28 m
short of the garage; its own ground is 612.47 → **3.63 m of air over raw
DEM** (no graded face within 45 m).  Both other pad-minting paths refuse
on the pack's flat render datum (no crest plate; basin depth 0.58 m <
2.5).  This is exactly the mismatch (10) forbids — "no building or
cluster can span multiple pads … they should match exactly" (14x) — and
the mechanism that closes it, `pad_from_cluster`, ships OFF because its
far field moved under the non-converging fixed point (14bk).  §20c now
converges (the one-vertex probe: nothing beyond 4.3 mm).

**RULED.**  (a) A unit member seated on a pad whose polygon does not
contain the member's footprint is the `pad_cluster_mismatch` defect at
that member — never a silent seat over air.  (b) `pad_from_cluster =
true` and `pad_airside_clip = true` are RE-MEASURED under `solver =
"qp"` on ONE tree: the owner's site (the garage) and HECA's 14 mismatch
residual, with (4)–(9) unchanged (leaves get no pad; the skirt yields,
never the airside; between aprons ≤ 1 %, low side).  (c) The pad under
the garage is the cluster outline through PKT4 b0/b1 at the terminal's
datum (616.10, one plane per (9) unless an apron on the far side says
otherwise); the terrain rises to it through the one-way skirt, and
`cluster_apron_reach_m` stays 0 (14bk).  (d) If the far field still
moves with the converged solver, the probe names WHERE and the flag
stays OFF with that number — the mechanism is not re-litigated by
narrative.

### §16g (10) (11) MEASURED (lane `v2padqp`, 2026-09-15; branch `claude/v2padqp`)

**THE OWNER'S SITE IS FIXED, AND IT IS THE FIRST NUMBER.**  The T4
garage `LEMD_OBJ-Airport_Terminal4_green-PKT4.obj` at 40.4892214,
−3.5944287 stands, pads OFF (the shipped law, = 1.0.340), 55.3 m OUTSIDE
the nearest `building` pad — `building12`, 581 nodes, median 616.35 —
which reproduces 15h's "the pad polygon ends 55.28 m short" exactly.
With `pad_from_cluster` + `pad_airside_clip` armed the garage point is
INSIDE its pad: in the closing build `building45`, a 93-node face of a
ref whose EVERY face reads median **615.35** (spread 0.05 within the
containing face), i.e. ONE level over the terminal and the garage
together.  PKT4 is a member of the walled cluster `unit:25#843` (421,940
m², 761 walled bodies, 23 resources incl. `Airport_Terminal4-LEMD01`) —
so the chain rule of (6)–(8) already reaches the terminal and **was not
widened**; the pad is that cluster's own outline.  The terrain under the
garage is now the pad, not raw DEM: z − DEM at the site **+5.14 → +4.33
m of FILL** (replay arms), no step over a short edge (0.0 m) either arm.
The `float` bar (body zero vs its own ground) is the OBJECT stage's
reading and is NOT measured here — a harness patch build emits the
design surface only; it is owed to an app build.  What is measured is
the thing 15h attributed: the seat's pad now CONTAINS the member.

**THE ONE-VERTEX PROBE — AND (11) (d) FIRES.**  Registered HECA
stability frame, `v2_solve_replay --why-from … --probe-site
30.1279552,31.403143 --probe-arm solver=qp`, one 0.30 m ceiling row:

| pads-ON arm | moved > 0.02 m | ≥ 250 m | ≥ 500 m | worst | hard under the probe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| clip at MINT (14ah's pre-split) | **0** / 32,262 | 0 | 0 | 0.0192 m (whole field) | 27 → 27 |
| clip at the ARRANGEMENT (this lane's (a)) | **16** / 32,182 | 16 | **16** | **0.1031 m** | 27 → 27 |

14bk's far-field mover is GONE under the converged solver with the pads
armed as `v2padcluster` r5 left them — nothing moves anywhere by more
than 4.3 cm, under the elevation materiality.  It COMES BACK, 16
vertices ALL beyond 500 m and worst 0.1031 m, when the mint stops
pre-splitting the outline and the arrangement's clip alone shapes the
pad — an interventional attribution of the residual far field to the
PAD/AIRSIDE RIM GEOMETRY, not to the solver.  Per (11) (d) the flag
stays OFF with that number.

**`pad_cluster_mismatch`, ATTRIBUTED AND PART-CLOSED.**  r5 left 14 and
named the cause ("the cluster piece and the emitted pad ref are cut in
different places").  Matched replay arms on ONE tree (census by
`harness/census.py`): HECA **16 → 10**, LEMD **1 → 1** (direct read of
`constraints.cluster_pad.pad_cluster_mismatch`: HECA 12 → 10, LEMD 3 →
2), and the owner's own T4 cluster LEFT the list — it was
`cluster_spans_pads unit:25#843/0 → building34/35/36`.  Three causes,
all at their single derivation site:

1. `_pads` cut the cluster polygon a SECOND time (the runway difference,
   `polygon_parts`) and gave each piece its own `building{N}`.  A part
   now takes ONE ref, its surplus pieces the tree's own `ref#k`.
2. `_face_map` joined on the RAW ref, so `building38` and `building38#1`
   — one pad to `publication` :597/:672 and `constraints/structures` —
   counted as two (LEMD `unit:25#1581`).  It joins on the base ref now.
3. The MINT pre-split the outline at the apt.dat airside union while the
   CENSUS split it at the PLANAR role faces — two cutters, and LEMD's T4
   cluster read as ONE 94,301 m² census piece against three minted refs.
   RULINGS 14ax already ruled the clip is `planar/overlay.airside_clip`'s;
   with that clip armed neither side pre-cuts now (with it disarmed both
   still do — 14ah's guard stands).  A piece under `[building_pad]
   min_area_m2` is also no longer judged: the mint drops it, so LEMD's 7
   m² and 3 m² slivers cannot make their building's ref a row.

**THE 10 HECA SURVIVORS ARE ONE CLASS, NAMED.**  Every one is
`cluster_spans_pads` over a NEIGHBOURING pad, and the instrument's own
per-FACE test is why: `_OWN_FACE_SHARE` asks whether a FACE is mostly
inside the cluster, so one sliver face of a big neighbouring pad puts
that whole ref on the list.  Measured: `unit:43#204` holds 94 % of
`building254`'s area and **2 %** of `building253`'s (8 faces, 4,373 m²);
`unit:43#612/0` 96 % of `building110` and **8 %** of `building107`;
`unit:43#844` 100 % of `building75` and 48 % of `building73`.  The
un-tried lever, named (the round's attempts are spent): weigh the REF's
own area inside the cluster, not one face's.  Survivors:
`unit:42#515/0`, `/2`, `unit:43#204`, `#267/0`, `#447/0`, `#612/0`,
`#687/1`, `#784/3`, `#844` and `pad_spans_clusters building281`; LEMD:
`unit:27#341/8` and `building25`.

**THE CENSUS PAIRS (matched replay arms, ONE tree, the only variable the
two `[placement]` keys).**

| | HECA OFF → ON | LEMD OFF → ON |
|---|---|---|
| ADJUDICATED | 26,608 → **26,285** (−1.2 %) | 1,371 → **1,376** (+0.4 %) |
| law-true total | 63,829 → 63,456 | 6,187 → 5,683 |
| `airside_no_step` | 7,747 → **7,487** | 455 → **445** |
| `within_shape` | 47,927 → **47,836** | 3,441 → 3,443 |
| `taxi_box` | 3,411 → **3,358** | 182 → 183 |
| `hairline_pair` | 2,749 → 2,795 (+1.7 %) | 1,882 → **1,388** |
| `pad_cluster_mismatch` | 16 → **10** | 1 → 1 |
| `pad_airside_weld` | 2 → **7** | 1 → **2** |
| `zone_on_pavement` | 0 → **0** | 0 → **0** |

WORSE BY MORE THAN 5 %, each named: HECA `pad_airside_weld` 2 → 7 and
`plane_gradient` 8 → 13 and `strip_seam_tear` 28 → 30; LEMD
`pad_airside_weld` 1 → 2, `strip_longitudinal` 4 → 5 and
`strip_transverse` 83 → 87.  `pad_airside_weld` is the bar's own
"0 new" clause and it is MISSED on both airports.

**THE AIRSIDE STILL MOVES, AND BY HOW MUCH.**  `airside_value_delta`
(canonical identity join, solve-owned frame, roles ∩
`law.tables.rolled_on_roles`) between the two HECA arms: **5,915**
airside vertices moved > 0.02 m, worst **3.61 m**; the RUNWAY **231**,
worst **0.140 m** (r5's shipped arm, a different frame: 9,573 and 885 /
0.390 m).  §16g (10) (5)'s bar is 0 and is MISSED; the runway is within
a tenth of a metre of quiet.

**THE CLOSING BUILD** — `build_airport.py LEMD --tag v2padqpLEMD2` with
both keys armed, on merged main: rc 0, **346.3 s**, ways 1,048, nodes
20,304, status `optimal`, `body_sha e5d30cf207a8`, artifact ledger
`50546224d866`, v2-verify 1,633 rows, and verbatim `[harness] shared
repo UNCHANGED by this build (full-surface before/after snapshot) — no
side-effect mutation`.  Its object stage reports the pad law defeating a
spurious pit at the garage: `refused basin:1 … 96 % under its own
objects' solids … a BASEMENT, not a pit: the terrain there is the
building's pad (building45) under the pad law`.  Suite **1,579 passed /
1 skipped** by FAILED lines.

**SHIPS OFF: `pad_from_cluster = false`, `pad_airside_clip = false`.**
Bar 6 is "flipped only if EVERY bar holds".  Three do not: the airside
moves (5,915 / 3.61 m), `pad_airside_weld` gains 5 rows at HECA and 1 at
LEMD, and `pad_cluster_mismatch` is 10 / 1 rather than 0.  The probe —
the reason 14bk shipped it OFF — is the bar that MOVED: under the
converged solver the pads-ON far field is nothing at all, or 16 vertices
at 0.10 m once the clip moves to the arrangement.  The owner's site is
fixed on the armed arm and the numbers above are the read it is
adjudicated on.

### §16g (10) (11) RULED ON THE MEASUREMENT (lane v2padqp r1 2039b3c0; Fable 2026-09-15; RULINGS 2026-09-15z) — the garage seats on its cluster's pad; the keys stay OFF until the AIRSIDE MOVEMENT is attributed

The garage (40.4892214, −3.5944287) with the keys armed: INSIDE
`building45` (the walled cluster `unit:25#843`'s own outline — 421,940
m², 761 walled bodies; the chain rule was never widened), one level
615.35 over the terminal and garage together, z − DEM +4.33 m of fill,
no short-edge step; the spurious basement pit refused as "a BASEMENT,
not a pit".  Three defects fixed at their derivation sites: `_pads`
re-cutting one cluster piece into separate `building{N}` refs (one ref
+ `ref#k` now); `_face_map` joining on the raw ref (`building38` vs
`building38#1`); the mint (apt.dat union) and the census (planar role
faces) cutting the airside differently.  `pad_cluster_mismatch` HECA
16 → 10, LEMD 1 → 1; the ten survivors are ONE class — `_OWN_FACE_SHARE`
is a per-FACE test, one sliver face of a neighbour lists the whole ref
(2 % / 8 % shares) — the untried lever: weigh the REF's area.  The one-
vertex probe with the pads as r5 left them: 0 of 32,262 moved > 0.02 m
— 14bk's far-field mover is GONE under §20c; with the clip moved to the
arrangement 16 vertices beyond 500 m, worst 0.103 m — the residual far
field is the pad/airside rim geometry, not the solver.

**MISSED, and why the keys stay OFF:** the AIRSIDE moved between the
OFF and ON arms — 5,915 vertices > 0.02 m, worst 3.61 m; runway 231,
worst 0.140 m (§16g (10) (5): a derived pad never takes airside ground;
airside is king) — r5's arm read 9,573 / 885 at 0.390 m, so this lane
halved it and did not close it; `pad_airside_weld` 2 → 7 HECA, 1 → 2
LEMD; HECA `plane_gradient` 8 → 13, `strip_seam_tear` 28 → 30; LEMD
`strip_transverse` 83 → 87.  RULED (r2): (a) ATTRIBUTE the airside
movement interventionally — `--why-at` on the worst airside mover
(3.61 m) and on the worst runway mover (0.140 m): which row set on the
ON arm reaches the airside (a pad weld row with the wrong direction? a
zone re-cut? the arrangement clip changing airside cells?) — the pad's
rows must be ONE-WAY toward the pad; an airside vertex that moves
because a pad exists is a defect at the row that moved it; (b) the
ref-area lever for the ten survivors; (c) the seven welds named.  The
keys flip ON only when airside movement is 0 (> 0.02 m) and the welds
are 0 new; the object-stage FLOAT at the garage (body zero vs its own
ground) is read on the next app build, not in the harness.

### §16g (10) (11) MEASURED, ROUND 2 (lane `v2padqp` r2, 2026-09-15; branch `claude/v2padqp`)

**(1) THE AIRSIDE MOVEMENT IS ATTRIBUTED, AND IT IS NOT A ROW OF THE PAD
LAW.**  `--why-at` on HECA's worst airside mover between the pads-OFF and
pads-ON arms (+3.610 m at 30.11038632205, 31.39574702991, roles `apron` +
`building`) named exactly ONE binding row on it: **the pad's own cap-0
plate**, `pads cap 0.00 % × 8.7 m`, dual **3.61**, over a vertex the
apron owns.  So the plate was pointed the one lawful way (below) and the
site re-read: the new worst mover (+3.28 m) carries **no binding pad row
at all** — its chain ends on an apron vertex `FREE: no binding row blocks
it … held by bending alone`.  The decisive count, by node identity
between the two emitted patches: of the **5,868** airside vertices that
moved, only **268** are SHARED with a pad at all; **5,600 touch no pad**
and still move up to 2.77 m.

**THE CHANNEL IS THE ARRANGEMENT CLIP, MEASURED INTERVENTIONALLY.**  A
third arm with `pad_airside_clip = true` and `pad_from_cluster = FALSE` —
the clip alone, no derived pad anywhere — against the same OFF arm:

| arm (vs pads-OFF) | airside moved > 0.02 m | worst | runway | runway worst |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **clip ALONE** | **4,474** | **1.39 m** | 17 | 0.100 m |
| clip + derived pads | 5,973 | 3.28 m | 189 | 0.200 m |

Three quarters of the moved vertices and nearly half the worst move are
bought by the CLIP, which re-cuts the airside faces around every pad
(1,082 solve-owned airside vertices gone, 235 new) — a different
arrangement, a different triangulation, a different smoothness optimum
over the whole field.  14as (i) armed the clip to make the airside
REGION independent of the pads (area-null, and it is); the airside
VERTEX SET is not, and that is what moves the surface.  §16g (10) (5)'s
bar of 0 cannot be reached at the pad's rows: it is a question about
whether the airside may be re-noded by a pad at all, and that is the
spec's to rule, not this lane's.

**WHAT THE ROW-LEVEL FIX DID BUY, ON THE SHIPPED SURFACE.**  A plate pair
with ONE end on airside is now priced ONE-WAY toward the pad (new head
`structures.building_pad flat airside-led`, in `one_way_rulings` and
`pad_flat_rulings` — same plate, same price, one lawful direction); a
pair the airside owns at BOTH ends is withdrawn; a pad with fewer than
three vertices of its OWN keeps its two-sided plate (three points make a
plane — the pad-in-an-apron class, measured on the §30 (4) twin at 0.86 m
when the pairs were withdrawn anyway), and a cluster's cross-links are
built from own vertices.  Measured on the PADS-OFF arm, the same capture,
the only variable this code: ADJUDICATED **26,608 → 25,521 (−4.1 %)**,
`airside_no_step` 7,747 → **7,344**, `taxi_box` 3,411 → **3,169**,
`within_shape` 47,927 → **47,201**, `transverse` −5 — the shipped
fallback pads stop dragging the apron too.  The price is
`pad_airside_weld` **2 → 8**: where the pad now yields instead of pulling,
the census says so, which is the family's whole job (14ai).

**(2) `pad_airside_weld`: NO NEW ROW.**  HECA OFF → ON **8 → 7**
(r1: 2 → 7); LEMD **2 → 3**.  The bar's "0 new" holds at HECA; LEMD's one
row is `building7`-class (a pad that cannot reach its non-apron airside
edge) and is named in the census rows.

**(3) THE REF-AREA LEVER CLOSES THE MISMATCH.**  `_OWN_FACE_SHARE` now
asks the share of the REF's whole area, not one face's — a pad IS a ref,
and asked per face one sliver face of a neighbour listed the whole ref.
**HECA `pad_cluster_mismatch` 10 → 0** (pads OFF, the shipped fallback
derivation: **15**), LEMD 2 → **1** (`unit:27#341/8` over `building25` /
`building26`, the OldTerminal chain).  (10)'s own bar — "pads must match
building clusters … exactly" — is MET at HECA with the pads derived and
MISSED by the shipped derivation.

**(4) THE CENSUS PAIRS (matched replay arms, one tree, final code).**

| | HECA OFF → ON | LEMD OFF → ON |
|---|---|---|
| ADJUDICATED | 25,521 → 25,612 (+0.4 %) | 2,118 → **1,377** (−35 %) |
| law-true | 62,456 → 62,592 | 6,911 → **5,606** |
| `pad_cluster_mismatch` | 15 → **0** | 0 → 1 |
| `pad_airside_weld` | 8 → **7** | 2 → 3 |
| `airside_no_step` | 7,344 → **7,280** | 444 → **440** |
| `transverse` | 1,315 → **1,277** | 117 → **109** |
| `frontage_near_miss` | 28 → **20** | 8 → **2** |
| `plane_gradient` | 8 → 12 | 0 → 0 |
| `strip_seam_tear` | 28 → **28** | 0 → 0 |
| `hairline_pair` | 2,749 → 2,795 | 1,882 → **1,388** |

`strip_seam_tear` is CLOSED (r1's 28 → 30 is gone: +0).  `plane_gradient`
8 → 12 is the residual, named: four more rows on the derived pads'
own planes, the class r1 also carried.  LEMD `strip_longitudinal` 4 → 5,
`strip_arc` 7 → 8 and `strip_transverse` 84 → 87 are the same order.

**(5) THE KEYS STAY FALSE.**  Deliverable (1)'s bar — airside movement 0
— is MISSED (HECA 5,973 / 3.28 m, runway 189 / 0.200 m; LEMD 1,651 /
2.36 m, runway 43 / 0.070 m) and the attribution says why it cannot be
met by a pad row: three quarters of it is the arrangement clip's own
re-noding.  Deliverable (2) is MET at HECA and +1 at LEMD; (3) is MET at
HECA.  Suite **1,613 passed / 1 skipped**, 0 FAILED.  No closing build:
the keys did not flip.  The owner's garage still seats on `building45`
(93-node face, median **615.09**, z − DEM **+4.06 m** of fill) on the
armed arm.

### §16g (10) (12) THE ARRANGEMENT CLIP PRESERVES THE AIRSIDE VERTEX SET — A PAD IS CLIPPED BY THE AIRSIDE CELLS, THE AIRSIDE CELLS ARE NEVER RE-CUT BY A PAD (Fable 2026-09-16; RULINGS 2026-09-16b) — lane `v2padclip`

**The measurement (v2padqp r2, RULINGS 15ah).**  With `pad_airside_clip`
alone (no derived pads) the airside moved 4,474 vertices (worst 1.39 m,
runway 17 / 0.100 m) against the pads-OFF arm — three quarters of the
movement the pad line was held for: the arrangement clip DELETES 1,082
solve-owned airside vertices and MINTS 235, i.e. it re-nodes the
airside faces.  14as (i) made the airside REGION pad-independent; its
VERTEX SET is not.  The one binding pad row found (the cap-0 plate over
an apron vertex) was pointed one-way in r2 and is not the cause.

**RULED.**  (1) The airside cells' geometry and vertex set are computed
BEFORE any pad exists and are NEVER modified by the pad stage: a pad
polygon is the cluster outline MINUS the airside union, clipped BY the
airside cells (their existing edges become the pad's boundary where
they touch), and the pad's own vertices are new vertices on the
pad's side of that boundary; where a pad edge meets an airside edge
the pad takes the airside's existing boundary vertices (shared by
identity, §16g (10) (6) the weld) and adds none to the airside cell.
(2) An airside vertex present in the pads-OFF arm is present, with the
same id/position, in the pads-ON arm; the census family
`pad_airside_renode` counts airside vertices deleted or minted by the
pad stage (bar 0).  (3) With (1)–(2) in force the flag is re-measured
(the v2padqp bars): airside moved > 0.02 m between the OFF and ON arms
→ 0 at HECA and LEMD (named survivors), `pad_airside_weld` 0 new,
mismatch HECA 0 (ref-area share), LEMD 1 named, the far-field probe ≤
0.02 m; then `pad_from_cluster` + `pad_airside_clip` ship TRUE and the
T4 garage (40.4892214, −3.5944287) seats on `building45` at one level
with the fill under it (r2: 615.09, +4.06 m).  Consumer census first
(every reader of the arrangement / the airside cells / the pad polygon
/ `_face_map` / the census cutters — the two cutters r1 aligned).

## RULINGS

## 2026-09-15ah v2padqp r2 MERGED OFF (b2294797 → 348f80a4): the airside movement ATTRIBUTED — ¾ of it is the ARRANGEMENT CLIP re-noding the airside vertex set (clip alone 4,474 / 1.39 m), not a pad row; the pad plate row pointed one-way improves the SHIPPED surface (HECA ADJUDICATED −4.1 %, LEMD −35 %); mismatch HECA 10 → 0 by the ref-area share; keys stay OFF — the clip is a spec question. OWNER (away): "no need to rebuild that app yet … complete the open lanes first"; the app killed and the road-layer refreshes run by the session on the owner's word

Lane @ b2294797; suite 1,639 passed, 0 FAILED. `--why-at` on HECA's

ONE binding row — the pad's cap-0 plate (`pads cap 0.00 % × 8.7 m`,
dual 3.61), two-sided over an apron-owned vertex → pointed one-way
(§16g (10) (11) (a)); the next worst mover carries NO pad row; 5,600 of
5,868 moved airside vertices touch no pad. Third arm (clip alone, no
derived pads): 4,474 moved / 1.39 m, runway 17 / 0.100 m — the
arrangement clip deletes 1,082 solve-owned airside vertices and mints
235; 14as (i) made the airside REGION pad-independent, not its VERTEX
SET. Bar 1 MISSED (HECA 5,973 / 3.28 m; LEMD 1,651 / 2.36 m) and cannot

re-node the airside at all — §16g (10) (12): the arrangement clip must
preserve the airside vertex set (the pad polygon is clipped BY the
airside cells, the airside cells are never re-cut by a pad). Owner

The first refresh chain (six tiles in one 600 s task) was stopped before it wrote anything; it left its own `osm_layers.lock` (pid 49618, dead) which the session removed — one refresh task per tile from here.

## 2026-09-15z v2padqp r1 MERGED OFF (2039b3c0 → main): the garage seats on its cluster's pad when armed (building45, 615.35, +4.33 m fill; the basement pit gone); three pad-ref defects fixed; mismatch HECA 16 → 10; the far-field mover GONE under §20c — but arming moves the AIRSIDE (5,915 vertices, worst 3.61 m; runway 231, worst 0.140 m) → keys stay OFF, r2 attributes

15z addendum: suite ON MAIN after the v2padqp merge: 1612 passed, 1 skipped, 42 warnings in 39.71s. Three of the four lanes are on main (v2lemdstruct2 287f9b5b + r2 6d25b68c, v2objcut 3b35df96, v2padqp 2039b3c0); v2vmmcshore r1 (a57abc47) is HELD for r2 (15w).

## 2026-09-14bk v2padjoin MERGED (cc71e237): the 14 red twins were ONE cause — c9787d1e shipped `staged_solve = true` (and `pad_airside_clip = true`) against 14as; the plane join as a stage-2 row set REFUTED (HECA infeasible 151 → 1,114 rows; the airside moved); captures now carry clusters — ruled: the collar is an APRON-LAW row set in stage 1

Lane `v2padjoin` @ 45655af6 (suite 1,525 twice; 1,533 on main with
all three flags OFF). Bar 0: `git revert d21b407c` reproduced 14bg's
14 failures; one flip (`staged_solve` false) → 1,524 — v2padvert's own
number: its report was NOT mislabeled, the arm flag shipped with the
commit (14bg's suspicion withdrawn). The join (14bf) in stage 2:
HECA pair (pads+clip+staged ON): infeasible 151 / 178.7 m → 1,114 /
2,312 m; stage 1 (airside) 4 → 8 rows, worst 0.033 → 0.108 — under
§20b the collar IS airside: stage 1 solves it without the pad and
substitutes it as a constant, so the plate must equal a collar
already fixed, and the all-airside collar pairs leak into stage 1 and
move the airside. Attempt 2 — the collar as one plane WITH ITSELF in
stage 1, the pad meeting it through its weld — refused before a
build by the §30 (4) twin ("a cluster is one plane over every pad it
stands on": the two pads came apart 0.86 m). The join deleted;
`cluster_apron_reach_m` stays 0.0. Chip `capclusters` landed here:
`--capture` derives `Airport.clusters`; a pre-fix capture backfills
at replay and says so; twins. Finding: with `pad_from_cluster` OFF
the §30 (4) cluster pad is structurally INERT (KCLT's six outlines
cover 5–6 % of `building80`'s face against `_OWN_FACE_SHARE` 0.5) — a
pads-OFF replay cannot measure the reach.

* RULING (the intent question — (i)): the reach is an APRON-LAW ROW
  SET INSIDE STAGE 1: the apron vertices within `cluster_apron_reach_m`
  (40 m) of a cluster's OUTLINE (known pre-solve from the plan, §16g
  (9)–(10)) form ONE PLANE among themselves (cap 0, tilt ≤ 1 %) in the
  airside solve — the airside deliberately flattens itself at a
  terminal (the owner, 2026-09-13; 14ay); bounded to the touching
  component, never across a taxi-family face; in stage 2 the pad's
  plate EQUALS that fixed collar plane (the pad takes the collar; the
  datum = the collar plane, the low side per (9)(2)). "Airside moved
  vs pads-OFF = the collar only" is the acceptance. The §30 (4) twin
  that refused attempt 2 encodes the SUPERSEDED law (one plane over
  MANY pads); under §16g (10) one cluster = one pad = one collar —
  RE-FOUND it. Lane `v2padjoin` r2.

## 2026-09-14x Owner: "pads must match building clusters, no building, or cluster can span multiple pads, if it does, it means we didn't identify the building shape or cluster correctly. They should match exactly." — §16g (10) THE PAD IS THE CLUSTER; §16g (8) narrowed

Owner, verbatim: "Agreed, pads must match building clusters, no
building, or cluster can span multiple pads, if it does, it means we
didn't identify the building shape or cluster correctly. They should
match exactly."

* RULING §16g (10): the design surface's `building` PAD IS the
  cluster's footprint — one pad per cluster, exactly its outline
  union, one level; and a cluster is ONE BUILDING: bodies chain into a
  cluster only if their footprints touch (§16g (7)) AND they share one
  authored floor level (within `floor_split_m`, 0.5 m — a body
  touching at a different authored floor is a different building, its
  own cluster, its own pad, joined by a declared terrace step). A pad
  spanning two clusters, or a cluster spanning two pads, is a census
  CRITICAL (`pad_cluster_mismatch`) — a misidentified shape, never
  seated over. §16g (8)'s "derived pads within a unit" is NARROWED to
  this: the offsets between touching clusters ARE the steps between
  their pads. HECA's 23-pad T3 district must resolve into as many
  clusters as it has floor levels, each on its own pad.
* Lane `v2connector` r6 (brief amended): the pad geometry is DERIVED
  from the cluster (the pad stage reads `airport.clusters`; the
  footprint-cache pads are the fallback where no cluster exists);
  consumer census of every pad reader; KCLT control.

## 2026-09-14ai Owner: "be sure all pads sharing an edge with airside must weld smoothly to the airside" — §16g (10) (6)

* RULING §16g (10) (6): a `building` pad (derived or footprint) that
  shares an edge with an airside face (runway family, taxi family,
  apron) WELDS to it: the pad's level along that edge equals the
  airside face's solved level there (the airside is the datum — airside
  is king — the pad takes the level, never the reverse), no step, and
  the pad's plane meets it within the pad's own slope cap; a pad that
  cannot meet its airside edge within cap is a census CRITICAL
  (`pad_airside_weld`), never a step. This is 09-01g's weld restated
  for derived pads and made census-visible; the seat of the cluster on
  such a pad follows the welded level. Lane `v2padcluster` r3 (same
  round): bar = every airside-sharing pad at HECA/KCLT welded (step
  along the shared edge ≤ `hard_tol_m`), named.

Lane v2shapes (2026-09-08): HECA capture 56 s; one pass 144–150 s (the 08g three-pass law read 357 s). `--why-from PKL --why-hump RUNWAY S0 S1` (the `solve.why` bindings and chain trace on the highest ridge vertex above the chord, from a duals solve of the SAME LP — kept out of the timed arm) with `--why-relax FAMILY ...` (relax-one-family arms: the hump's dz after a full re-solve without the family — the INTERVENTIONAL holder read). `--why-hard [N]` lists EVERY VIOLATED HARD ROW of the solved surface — generator, ruling, demanded vs allowed metres, and per vertex the id, coefficient, z, DEM, lat/lon and roles — re-assembling the design problem with `solve.design.assemble` and applying design.py's own `2 / Σ|c|` row scaling, so every violation reads in the METRES `hard_tol_m` is stated in (promoted from scout `v2unsettled2`'s `hardrows.py` on its second use, spec §32 (4), RULINGS 2026-09-13ac: `HARD SET NOT SETTLED` names ONE truncated ruling, which cost 12u a scout re-deriving the population by hand and 13ac needed the row's VERTICES to see that main's worst row was a pair the zone projection had clamped independently).  **`--why-hard-stage 1`** reads §20b STAGE 1's OWN ASSEMBLY instead of the full problem's (`solve.design.stage_split`'s drop + fixed): the AIRSIDE hard set, in the rows and the metre scaling stage 1 enforced them under. The full read cannot answer "does the AIRSIDE solve settle" — the airside rows are a subset of 325k whose population and scaling the stage's own drop changes — and that is exactly the claim RULINGS 13y (B) / 13ab / 14as make (lane `v2settle`, which used it to split HECA's "42 unsettled rows" into 9 CONSTANT rows the solve can never move, 6 HELD runway rows at the projection's own bar, and 18 real ones).  The shipped surface is read either way: an airside vertex's z IS stage 1's, so the stage-1 read at the shipped z equals the read at stage 1's own surface (measured identical at HECA). **`--emit` IS THE BUILD'S WHOLE EMIT HALF SINCE 2026-09-13** (lane `v2zonebank`, §37 (3)): it ran `graded_surface` -> `write_patch` and SKIPPED `with_bank` / `with_terrain_edges`, so every `bank_foot` question asked of a replay arm read ZERO feet and looked like the defect under attribution — it now runs `pipeline/build.py:780-795` verbatim and prints the `BankReport` line. **`--bank-from SOLVED.pkl`** replays that emit half alone off a `--solved-out` pickle (KCLT 2.5 s against the 160 s `--replay`), with `--emit DIR` and/or **`--bank-walk`**: §37 (3)'s per-station ADJACENT-GROUND ZONE-2 WALK — per `adjacent_ground:*:zone2` face ring, `|z_ring - DEM(foot)|` at every station, the stations at or over `bank_materiality_m`, whether the foot point stands outside the design coverage, whether it falls in the terrain-edge no-bank region or the water cut, and whether a `bank_foot` stands within that station's OWN 1:3 reach (never the airport-wide `bank_max_width_m`, which calls a foot 200 m away near); then, off `emit/bank.with_bank`'s `station_probe` / `region_probe` attribution hooks, the banked-region station the load-bearing verdict was actually taken on and where an unbanked station stands (inside the banked region? inside a coverage HOLE?). It prices no law and counts no defects — defect counts come from `harness/census.py`. Measured basis (KCLT, base `ce203b29`, `cap/KCLT.pkl`): 233 zone2 rings / 5,647 stations, 542 at or over the 1.65 m materiality, 220 with their foot outside the coverage, **110 with no foot at all** — 110 of them inside the banked region and 109 inside a coverage hole, which is how RULINGS 2026-09-13bu item 5 was attributed to `_foot_piece`'s solid exterior disc; after the fix 8. **A CAPTURE PREDATING A TARGET CHANNEL STILL REPLAYS, AND SAYS SO** (2026-09-13, lane `v2roadcontact`): a `PlanarMap` field added since the pickle was written is simply ABSENT on the unpickled instance, so the first `dataclasses.replace` raised `AttributeError` and a REGISTERED FRAME another lane shares became unreplayable for a channel its own stage never produced; `--replay` now backfills each missing field at the dataclass's OWN default and NAMES it on stdout (the publisher derives the channel in the replay anyway). This is NOT a relaxation of the 12u groups refusal, which stands: that one is a capture solving a DIFFERENT problem, this one is a channel the capture never had. Twins: `tests/auto_patch_v2/test_v2padceiling.py` (the capture calls every pre-solve stage `pipeline/build.build` calls, read off both sources; the refusal predicate).  **`--probe-site LAT,LON` IS THE STABILITY PROBE** (lane `v2qp`, spec §20c, promoted from lane `v2settle` r2's `scratchpad/v2settle/probe3.py`/`probe4.py` on its second use): off a `--solved-out` pickle, one extra `Band` ceiling `--probe-drop` (default 0.30) metres under the ARM's OWN base surface at the vertex nearest the point, re-solved, and the moved set (> 0.02 m) binned by distance from it — 0-40 / 40-100 / 100-250 / 250-500 / beyond, with the worst beyond 250 m, each arm's hard set and its exit line.  `--probe-arm TERM=V` repeated makes it a MATCHED PAIR of `[design]` arms on ONE problem (`--probe-arm solver=fixed_point --probe-arm solver=qp` is §20c's own bar); with none it probes the shipped law alone.  This is the instrument RULINGS 2026-09-14bw's headline was taken on (HECA: 959 vertices moved by one 0.30 m row, 953 beyond 500 m, ZERO within 100 m).  `--design-weight TERM=V` also takes a NON-NUMERIC value now (§20c's `solver=qp`); a value that does not parse as a float is passed through as the string.    **`--placement KEY=V` IS THE CAPTURE-TIME LAW ARM** (lane `v2padqp`, spec §16g (10) (11)): the §16g (10) pad keys (`pad_from_cluster`, `pad_airside_clip`) are read in `classify/evidence._pads` and `planar/overlay` — UPSTREAM of the capture — so `--design-weight` (a `[design]` override applied at REPLAY) cannot arm them and a pads-ON replay of a pads-OFF capture silently measures the pads-OFF law; a matched OFF/ON pair is therefore TWO CAPTURES of one tree, never two edits of the shipped toml (the value is coerced to the key's own type, an unknown key refuses by name, and the arm is recorded in the pickle).  `--capture` also arms `harness/build_airport.arm_shared_repo_protection` — the ONE arming composition — and prints `[guard] shared repo UNCHANGED`.  **`--rule SECTION.KEY=V` IS THE CAPTURE-TIME CLASSIFY ARM** (lane `v2shoulderband`, spec §40 (5)): the same thing for `classify/rules.toml` that `--placement` is for `[placement]` — a CLASSIFY key is read upstream of the capture (the capture HOLDS the classification, so `--from planar` cannot see a classify change at all), which makes a matched pair on one TWO CAPTURES; doing that by editing the shipped toml between the arms is the defect RULINGS 2026-09-15az records (disarming a head by prefix also deleted `foot_row_rulings` and silently re-priced every foot row), so the arm is ONE COMMAND-LINE VARIABLE on one unedited tree instead. `SECTION.KEY=VALUE`, coerced to the key's own type, an unknown section or key refuses BY NAME, and the arm is printed on stdout — e.g. `--rule corridor.runway_shoulder_band=false`.  Twin: `tests/auto_patch_v2/test_v2qp.py` (the probe as a fixture pair) — the rest of the replay is an instrument over `pipeline/build.py`'s own stages, which the pipeline twins cover. |

## Tool: pad_span_census

| `Ortho4XP/tools/pad_span_census.py` | The question is DOES THIS UNIT'S OWN DATUM FIT ITS BODIES' PADS — *how far apart do the emitted `building` pads one FOOTPRINT UNIT stands on actually stand?* — the single number owner RULINGS 2026-09-14c item 1 is accepted or refused on (spec `object-placement-spec.md` §16g (1)/(7)). No other instrument asks it: `harness/census.py` prices PAIRS OF VALUES, so an object seated 23.70 m above its own pad breaks no grade law and reports ZERO rows; `obj8_split_report.py` prints a body's anchor and its own ground but never asks whether the bodies sharing ONE unit's datum stand on pads that disagree; `role_overlap_read.py` is an AREA sweep and `role_edge_census.py` a boundary-length one. This is the unit-vs-pad reading: per unit, the `building` pads its bodies' FEET fall inside, how many bodies it holds, and the SPAN of those pads' planes, largest first. **It measures no law and counts no defects** — the pads are the emitted design surface's own `building` faces at `median(z)` over the ring, which is the plane `footprint_unit` reads through `anchor_rule.pad_plurality`, and the body→part join is the PART ID, never a proximity match (memory `canonical-identity-join`). `--over` (default 1.0 m) is the listing floor 14g stated its bar in, not a threshold with any standing. It takes either `o4_v2_placement_<ICAO>.json` or an `obj8_split_report --json` dump — both carry the same `splits` body records. Measured basis (scout `v2heca331` on the owner's 1.0.331 HECA): 17 units whose pads span > 1 m over 1,363 bodies, `fu:38:20` alone 978 bodies on 136 pads spanning 34.8 m — the unit chained on PART BOXES, and its DECK member then gave 96.20 to 1,509 bodies. Promoted 2026-09-14 from that scout's scratchpad `padspan.py` on its SECOND use (RULINGS `7e90032`, promote-on-reuse) — the 14g attribution, then lane `v2connector` round 3's before/after. Several patches are reported separately; quote it on identical options. Twin: `tests/test_pad_span_census.py` (the span IS the unit's own pads, a non-`building` face is not a pad, a unit on one pad is not a row, a body with no `unit_of` is not counted, the floor both ways, the CLI's JSON IS the library result, and this index row). |

## Tool: pad_airside_arm

| `Ortho4XP/tools/pad_airside_arm.py` | **THE PAD/AIRSIDE INVARIANCE ARM** (RULINGS 2026-09-14as (i), lane `v2padvert`; promoted from that lane's scratchpad on its eighth use per RULINGS `7e90032`). `V2PADVERT_ENGINE=<engine tree> venv/bin/python tools/pad_airside_arm.py ICAO OUT.json` — ONE load, then classify+planar TWICE (`[placement] pad_from_cluster` OFF then ON) and a diff of §20b stage 1's OWN airside vertex population (`solve/design_roles.airside_stage_vertices`, never a hand list) and the apron face list between the arms. It answers "does deriving the pads change the AIRSIDE PROBLEM" — 14as (i)'s prerequisite — in ~3 min at HECA against a ~450 s build, and it is a READER: no solve, no emit, nothing written but its own JSON. The shared-repo write guard and the lane-local cache redirects come from `harness/build_airport.arm_shared_repo_protection` (the ONE arming composition) and every run prints `[guard] shared repo UNCHANGED`. It also prints `classify/evidence.PAD_AIRSIDE` (what the airside clip and the rim snap did, with every refusal by reason) and, per NEW airside vertex, its distance to the other arm's nearest airside VERTEX and to its airside BOUNDARY — the two readings that separate a clip crossing point from an identity-grid artefact. MEASURED at HECA, gone/new: main 280/88; the clip alone 59/79; clip + vertex snap 28/35; clip + snap + the never-delete exemption 41/151. Twin: `tests/auto_patch_v2/test_v2padvert.py`. |

## Tool: check_grade

| `Ortho4XP/tools/check_grade.py` | You want the grade validator's CLI on one patch, or its library from code. The CLI is a thin front end over the same law reader the census uses. A run with no sidecar is CONTEXT-FREE and overcounts — it is not a defect count. It also prints **THE COCKPIT BLOCK FIRST** (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12x/12y; §31 (6)) — the same `cockpit_block` / `cockpit_block_lines` the harness census and the pytest fixtures call, over the SAME run's `family_out` (the checks' own output is buffered and replayed under the block, never run twice). A `strip_seam_tear` row carries the PAIR MIDPOINT as its lat/lon (spec §32 (3), RULINGS 2026-09-12ag): it used to carry none, and `run_checks` filled it with the offending way's RING CENTROID — at LEMD that sent the cockpit block's first CRITICAL VISUAL find 220 m from the 8.25 m tear. Twinned both sides (`tests/auto_patch_v2/test_v2zoneclamp.py`), the engine's own `verify/strips.strip_seam_tear` alongside. The block's "in view by approach" test is the ONE approach corridor of `auto_patch_v2.law.approach_corridor` (RULINGS 2026-09-12al; twins `tests/auto_patch_v2/test_v2approachcorridor.py`), never a radius around a runway vertex. **`adjacent_ground_step`** (spec §34 (4), lane `v2rampwalk` 2026-09-13) is the WITHIN-FACE welded step on a v2 `adjacent_ground:*` face — the reading no family had: `graded_strip` carries no within-shape cap, `adjacent_ground_tear` fires only under a 1 m edge and `strip_seam_tear` is the CROSS-shape twin, so a band holding its designed level over a mapped road's own ground (LEMD `zone2#2`, 1.73 m over 1.5 m at road −6289) was priced by nothing. Its floor is the cockpit's own `visual_m` AND `cliff_grade` in one step: without the cliff term it counts the lawful hillside drape (measured CYXY 296 rows). Lockstep both sides — `auto_patch_v2.verify.strips.adjacent_ground_step` reads it in the engine; twins `tests/auto_patch_v2/test_v2rampwalk.py` and the v1/v2 census parity test. **`ramp_in_road`** (spec §34 (10), owner RULINGS 2026-09-14bb/14bc/14bd, lane `v2othhramp`) is the CRITICAL presence family the road margin needed: every ramp arriving at a road ends at the road's TRUE edge — the centreline offset by the road's own half-width toward the ramp, ONE derivation `planar/wall_corridor_ramps.road_true_edge` read by every ramp emitter — so a RAMP vertex standing INSIDE a road ribbon is a lane of carriageway cut away, whatever its elevation. No other family sees it: a ramp welded flat into the road it ate breaks no grade law and prices zero rows. A vertex within the census's own weld tolerance of the ribbon's edge is ON the edge, which is what the law asks for. It reads 0 at OTHH before and after — the family is the GUARD on that derivation and never a defect count. Twins: `tests/test_harness.py` §34 (10) (both directions, the weld line both ways, the register and the cockpit class, and the ramp-role set read from the law's own structure roles). **`ramp_in_strip`** (spec §34 (5) (b), Fable 2026-09-15 / RULINGS 2026-09-15h, owner 15e item 7, lane `v2lemdstruct2`) is its AIRSIDE sibling: the covered extent of an underpass beneath a taxiway or runway spans the pavement AND its graded strip, so a RAMP vertex standing inside that strip is a trench in the ground an aircraft leaving the pavement runs out onto — LEMD 40.4611623,-3.5444804, where a code-E strip is 19.0 m and the trench face stood at 15.5 m under a 5.42 m unbanked drop, the airport's worst CRITICAL VISUAL row. The strip region is ONE derivation with `planar/zones.zone_regions` and `planar/structure_underpass.strip_half_width_m` (the zone-2 half width for the cell's class, the zone-1 LIP where the class declares none), read from the LAW with a literal no-engine fallback the twin asserts against. TWO READINGS MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN: the face's sidecar HOLES are applied and the pavement SOLID is subtracted, so the region is the BAND — read ring-blind and disc-shaped the first arm reported 52 LEMD rows, every one inside `cross_connector:pav61`'s own 144,429 m2 void and up to 220 m from any kerb, and `de_m` can now never exceed the class's own half width. Twins: `tests/test_harness.py` §34 (5) (b) (both directions, the class's own half width against the zone law and the planar derivation, the taxiway-loop void, the weld line both ways, the register and the cockpit class). **THE RUNWAY SHOULDER'S OWN CAP** (spec §40 (2) as amended, owner RULINGS 2026-09-13dd, lane `v2roles`): a within-shape pair BOTH of whose nodes lie beyond their runway's own half width is priced at `shoulder_transverse_max` (2.5 %, ICAO Annex 14 §3.2.4), not the runway's 1.5 % — a §40 (1) SHOULDER keeps the runway's DATUM, not its cross-fall. The line is the SOLVE's and is read, never re-derived: the sidecar's `runway_axes` (`[ref, lat_a, lon_a, lat_b, lon_b, half_m]` off the apt.dat ends and width) and `shoulder_transverse_max`, through `shoulder_nids` / `_shoulder_cap`. Fitting the width to the runway RINGS instead would read a shoulder as part of the runway and never find its own line. A patch with no key reads exactly as before. One reading with the generator and the v2 verify (`auto_patch_v2.law.tables.runway_transverse_cap`); twins `tests/auto_patch_v2/test_runway_shoulder.py`. |

## Tool: census

| `Ortho4XP/tools/harness/census.py` | You need DEFECT COUNTS from an emitted patch. Every law family always (the register, never a hand list), law-true frame from the patch's own sidecar, airside/groundside/mixed split, worst-N rows, class table, sidecar evidence, JSON + table, A/B across patches. **The only numbers that may be quoted as defect counts.** `--zone-split` additionally buckets the within-shape rows by FAN-RAMP ZONE membership (on a declared ramp piece / inside a zone / crossing one / unrelated, plus the rows already steeper than the zone cap) — reach for it when a grade law grants relief on declared ground and you need to know whether the relief is where the defects are. It is a flag and not its own tool because it needs the census's law-true frame; a private copy of that frame is the census-wrapper defect above. `--magnitude-bands [EDGES]` buckets EVERY law-true row by severity (|de| / step height; default edges `0.01,0.1,1,10` m, or your own ascending list) with the airside/groundside/mixed and adjudicated/version-deferred splits per band — reach for it when the question is which KIND of population a total is, not how big it is (the frame of record is stated in these terms: "0.1-1 m 13,711 = 45.1 %, 1-10 m 11,143 = 36.7 %, 82 % is in-band airside solver residual"). The bands PARTITION the census's own rows and the band below the first edge is the materiality floor's own. Promoted 2026-08-06 from the two lane copies that hand-rolled it (c6attr, c6tip). `--frame own\|base` selects the AXIS FRAME: `own` (default) is the patch's own sidecar and the only frame whose numbers are defect counts; `base` re-reads the SAME patch bytes with the SERVICE axes removed from its sidecar — the axis population a pre-road-feed sidecar carried — which is what splits "the class moved because the surface moved" from "…because the axis frame moved" (cycle 9/10: HECA 10 000 m read airside 4,610 own-frame and 4,474 base-frame, and the whole gap was ONE instrument defect). A base-frame number is a FRAME claim, never a defect count; the frame is stamped into every report either way (`axis_frame`). Added 2026-08-07 (cycle 10) in place of the hand-built filtered sidecars the cycle-10 probe made and threw away. `--rows-json OUT.json` additionally ITEMISES every law-true row — family, role pair, side, magnitude, grade/cap, site in layout-local metres, lat/lon, way ids — which is what turns a class table into an attribution: a net class delta hides equal churn by construction (a class that gains 200 rows at one site and loses 18 at another reads as "+182"), and only the rows say WHICH rows and WHERE. It is the census's own `all_rows`, the same population every count in the report is taken from, so the dump and the counts beside it can never disagree — `tests/test_harness.py` asserts the dump's class tally IS the report's class table, its side split IS the report's, and the worst-N table is its prefix. With several patches you get one dump per patch (a single file would silently keep the last). Added 2026-08-07 (cycle 10) for the road-pair receiver-only round's +182 decomposition. `--sites` clusters those same rows into DEFECT SITES and reports the other headline: how many DISTINCT defects a patch carries (law-true and adjudicated), ROWS PER SITE — the AMPLIFICATION FACTOR — per-site worst |de| / step and worst grade excess, the families, role pairs and shape ids each site spans, its bbox + centroid lat/lon, and a SIM-VISIBILITY flag. Reach for it whenever a row total is about to be quoted as a defect count to a human: row counts AMPLIFY and site counts do not — one over-cap region on one apron mints hundreds of edge-granularity rows (HECA's way -12407 alone carries ~800; the road-feed round's 180 threshold-flip sites live on 19 shapes, 72 % of them on four aprons), so "thousands of defects" is a count of PAIRS THE LAW PRICED and differs from the number of things wrong with the surface by whatever the amplification happens to be on that patch. THE CLUSTERING RULE, printed with every table so a site count is never read without it: two rows join one site iff SAME LAW FAMILY and (shared way id OR shared canonical node), where a canonical node is the census's own weld tolerance (`LAW_TRUE_KNOBS['proximity_m']` = `check_grade.SHARED_VERTEX_TOL_M`, 0.5 m) applied to the rows' endpoints in layout-local metres — the law's own "these two vertices are one node" predicate, never a proximity semantic invented for a report; sites are the connected components (union-find), and no magnitude, role or geometry test takes part. `--site-visibility M` moves the visibility threshold (default 0.05 m of relief = silhouette-visible candidate); it is a REPORTING threshold and an assumption — nothing has measured it in the sim — never a law, and the law still adjudicates every row regardless. `--sites-json OUT.json` dumps every site with its full membership as row indices into the census's own magnitude-sorted order, so it joins a `--rows-json` dump by position. The sites PARTITION the census's own population — `census_one` REFUSES if they do not, and `tests/test_harness.py` §9 carries the known-answer twin (two hand-built sites, one joined by way id and one by weld, asserting count, membership, amplification and both visibility flags) plus the union-equals-`all_rows` lockstep. Added 2026-08-07 (cycle 10) for the owner's "why does the battery still read thousands of defects" question. **THE HEADLINE the section reports is ACTIONABLE SITES** — the MATERIALITY FLOOR (owner RULINGS 2026-08-07, "we don't need to be grading to less than 0.5m") adjudicated per site, since a site is the unit that sentence is about: 40 one-centimetre rows on one apron are one place owing 0.4 m of grading, not 40 defects. A site is actionable when its ADJUDICATED rows accumulate ≥ **0.5 m** of unlawful excess, OR one of them is a single step ≥ **0.15 m** or sits at ≥ **2× its own cap** (the SHARP GUARD — "we don't want any sharp bumps", the half a bare accumulation floor throws away), OR it touches the **RUNWAY FAMILY** (`runway` / `runway_crossing`), which is never floored because reg-derived precision governs there. Every constant is a named knob in `check_grade` (`MATERIALITY_FLOOR_M`, `MATERIALITY_SHARP_STEP_M`, `MATERIALITY_SHARP_GRADE_CAP_MULTIPLE`, `MATERIALITY_RUNWAY_FAMILY_ROLES`) citing the ruling, and all of them ride in every report beside the counts — the floor is PROVISIONAL and two site tables taken at two floors are not comparable. ACCUMULATION is `check_grade.row_excess_m` summed over the site's adjudicated rows only (a version-deferred or out-of-scope row is not a defect and may not fund one): the EXCESS, not the magnitude — a 3.2 m rise over 200 m of 1.5 %-capped taxiway is a 3.2 m magnitude and a 0.2 m excess. A family that prices a CAP rather than metres (`MATERIALITY_UNMEASURED_FAMILIES`, today `lateral_contiguity`, whose `de_m` is a bare grade difference over no span) funds nothing AND keeps its site actionable — a floor may only relax what it can measure. A site the floor takes out is REPORTED under the **`sub_floor`** label with its rows and worst |de| (counted-never-dropped, the `VERSION_DEFERRED_FAMILIES` / `disconnected_ring` convention), and actionable + sub-floor PARTITIONS the adjudicated sites — `census_one` REFUSES if it does not. Twins: `tests/test_harness.py` §10 (both sides of every constant, each guard half proven to fire ALONE, the runway exemption, the label locked to its register, the production refusal). Alongside it, ROLE-LESS FEATURE WAYS SIDE WITH THEIR HOST (lead ruling 2026-08-07): an `o4_feature` way with no `role` tag — `shape_interior_ring` / `gap_interior_ring` / `gap_drainage_spine` / `crown_spine`, 232 of them at HECA — used to fall through to the caller's default 1.5 % cap and to AIRSIDE whatever its host was; `check_grade.resolve_feature_hosts` (shared-node majority, ties on `layout.AUTHORITY_RANK`) and the drainage law's own parent selection now supply the role and side for REPORTING ONLY — the `role` tag is law input and is never written — and a row whose host's vertex set COVERS it is adjudicated `role_less_host_duplicate` (one geometry, one row set), reported under its own heading and never dropped. §10b twins. `--no-cache` / `--clear-cache` govern the CENSUS CACHE: the full report is memoised under `Ortho4XP/tmp/census_cache` (lane-local, gitignored, `$O4_CENSUS_CACHE_DIR`, REFUSED inside the shared data repo, and off inside pytest unless the root is named) keyed by the patch BODY sha (`build_airport.body_sha256`, the `tail -n +3` the frozen MANIFESTs speak) AND the whole-file sha (the census PRINTS the provenance stamp the body hash excludes), the sidecar BYTES (never an enumeration of its law keys — that is the wrapper defect), the run ledger's own code-tree hash (`run_with_ledger.code_tree_hash`, so a `check_grade.py` edit misses), `LAW_TRUE_KNOBS`, the `O4_*` environment and the option frame. A hit re-prints the stored report and re-writes the stored `--json` / `--rows-json` / `--sites-json` bytes, so it is the fresh output plus exactly ONE line — the `[CENSUS CACHE HIT] …` marker, first, immediately before the `=== CENSUS …` header, printed even under `--quiet`; a miss prints nothing. No number, family or law changes: memoisation, not measurement. Twin: `tests/test_census_cache.py`. The census also prints THE BUILD'S OWN AIRSIDE-SCOPED CERTIFICATE beside its counts (air7, RULINGS 2026-09-01l/r): the solve's law-graph verdict on the zero-airside beta bar, read verbatim from the sidecar's `airside_certificate` EVIDENCE key (readings per certificate site + the last-exit verdict; row-side partition, check_grade's quantization allowance imported) — a DIFFERENT instrument over a DIFFERENT population (law edges at exit vs emitted node pairs): agreement is corroboration, disagreement is a finding, and neither replaces the other. Twins: `tests/test_solve_certificate_instrument.py` TASK 6. **THE COCKPIT BLOCK IS PRINTED FIRST** (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12x/12y; `design-surface-spec.md` §31 (6), lane `v2cockpit`): before any other line the census classifies its OWN rows into CRITICAL MOTION (a `step`-class family over `[cockpit] motion_step_m` 0.05 m BETWEEN WELDED NEIGHBOURS — ends no farther apart than `emit.instrument.step_contact_tol_m`, the law's own weld spacing — where BOTH roles are ROLLED-ON — the runway family, the taxi family and the apron, derived from `precedence.toml`, never a literal list — plus the `grade_break` families the runway/taxi rate laws forbid, which carry no span test because a curve is long by definition), CRITICAL VISUAL (a WELDED `step`-class row over `visual_m` 0.5 m inside the airport boundary or within `approach_km` 5 km of a runway axis) and REPORT (everything else: every slope excess, every keep-out row, everything under a threshold, and everything beyond the view — §31 (4), "centimetres are not a goal"), each with its count, worst magnitude and worst COORDINATE. It is a CLASSIFICATION and never a measurement: no row is created, dropped or re-priced, and `cockpit_block` REFUSES if its three buckets do not add up to the population handed in. **THE SPAN RULE** (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12ad, round 2): a step-family row read SPANNED — ends farther apart than the weld spacing — is a SLOPE, not a discontinuity: it is grade, judged by its own cap, and is REPORT.  Round 1 classed a 2.69 m rise over 81 m of LEMD taxiway as critical motion and the block read 452; every one of those rows was spanned and LEMD now reads 0.  The REPORT line names what the rule moved — how many spanned rows would be over the motion threshold and how many over the visual one if they were welded — so the count is never folded into an anonymous total.  **THE CLIFF ESCAPE** (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12af, round 3) bounds it: a spanned row whose implied grade `|dz| / span` exceeds `[cockpit] cliff_grade` is a CUT or a RISE, not ground, and is judged as though it were welded, under its own reason `cliff` (on rolled-on pavement CRITICAL MOTION — no aircraft rolls a 1:3).  LEMD's `strip_seam_tear`, 8.27 m over 3.01 m = 275 %, is the row that made the rule.  The escape restores the BUCKET, never the threshold: a 0.4 m cliff is still under `visual_m` and still invisible.  `cliff_grade` holds a DOTTED LAW PATH (`emit.design.bank_slope`), never a number: the design surface's own 1:3 bank is already the line between "ground a pilot reads" and a wall, and `tables.cliff_grade` resolves it — change the bank and the cliff line follows, with no second copy to drift.  The loader refuses a path that does not name a grade in (0, 1] over the motion threshold.  **ROUND 4** (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12aj) repaired three READER defects the block's own output exposed, all in `check_grade.py`: the three RATE/ARC readers (`strip_arc`, `raoa`, `airside_no_step`'s §1.2 half) built rows with NO lat/lon, so `run_checks`'s fallback stamped each with the CENTROID OF ITS RING — 36 rows of LEMD apron `pav12` printed one coordinate 560 m from the wall they had found, and a whole round of attribution went to the wrong place; every rate row now carries its own pair midpoint (`_rate_row_site`, off a projection that gained an `inverse`). A rate row's `distance_m` published the HALF span `0.5*(dp+dn)` while its `de_m` spans `dp+dn`, so every implied grade read 2x (LEMD's five apron rows printed 0.37-0.46 and are really 0.20-0.23); it is now the full separation, and the allowance keeps the half span because that is the rate law's own averaging term. And the CLIFF ESCAPE now reaches EVERY family, not only `step` ones — LEMD's two sharpest readings of the same wall, a `within_shape` 81 % and a `cross_shape` 240 %, are class `grade` and could not be cliffs at all — while `row_roles` returns THE FACES ON EACH SIDE of the pair rather than the ring it was walked on: a within-shape pair has one ring for both ways, so the pad rim standing over the apron read `building|building` and the rolled-on test called it landside. `run_checks` indexes every node to the SENIOR face carrying it (`precedence.toml` authority order, an identity join on emitted coordinates at millimetre quantisation — never a proximity match) and stamps `role_a`/`role_b`; `row_roles` prefers them. A patch with no `boundary` role way (v2 emits none today) says so and the approach corridor alone decides view. IN VIEW BY APPROACH IS **THE APPROACH CORRIDOR** (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12al, §31 (2)): per runway END, `[cockpit] approach_km` beyond the threshold along the extended centreline and `approach_half_width_m` to each side, derived ONCE in `src/auto_patch_v2/law/approach_corridor.py` and read by the engine's mouth gate (`planar/structure_approach.FieldRegion`, §29 (1)) through the same class — the harness takes its axes from the emitted runway rings, the engine from the apt.dat thresholds. The first reading, "within `approach_km` of a runway axis", admitted the whole airport (at LEMD 4,318 of 4,408 rows, at HECA 8,122 of 37,364 — the corridor leaves 90 and 29,242 of them respectively behind) and is DELETED, not gated. Every family's class lives in `law/families.toml` (`cockpit = step|grade_break|grade|keepout`, REQUIRED — a new family without one does not load) and the four numbers in `law/emit.toml [cockpit]`. Twins: `tests/test_harness.py` §7. **§38 THE TILE SEAM (owner RULINGS 2026-09-13ah / 13am / 13an; lane `v2seampin`)** adds the two families the census had no instrument for. `seam_residual` prices every tile-seam band-edge vertex against ITS OWN tile's baked DEM sample — the value the solve PINNED, published per pin in the sidecar as `seam_pins` = `[lat, lon, dem_z]` (all of them since 13ah; the M3a sidecar published only the subset a soft preference happened to honour). Class `step`, so the cockpit rule gives it CRITICAL MOTION on the rolled-on roles and VISUAL elsewhere with no second threshold. It is the reader the SPLP berm needed: 106 rows, max 3.433 m, 31 of them CRITICAL MOTION on `runway|runway` (worst 0.629 m) — while `strip_seam_tear` read 0 over the same 3 m ridge. `bank_across_seam` prices any `bank_foot` node inside the band (`seam_half_width_m`, also published), class `keepout`: one node is the whole defect, because 13an measured a chain 0.0237 m off the meridian that Triangle4XP split 16,298 times against the unsplittable tile border. The bank foot is ROLE-LESS, so this family reads the `feature_out` channel of `_parse_osm`, not `ways` — a reader that walked `ways` prices nothing. Both are sidecar-declared like `eat_ceiling`: a patch with no key (v1's output, or a v2 patch predating §38) reports nothing and reads exactly as before. This is where the lane's seam-vertex/DEM probe was PROMOTED to (RULINGS `7e90032` second-use rule) — there is no separate script. Twins: `tests/test_harness.py` §38 (both directions of both families, at SPLP's own worst numbers, plus the cockpit classes read out of `families.toml`). |

| `Ortho4XP/tools/census_matrix.py` | You have MANY census JSONs — a multi-airport, multi-world round's arms — and the question is "did any cell's AIRSIDE count RISE against the arm we promised not to regress" (the Q4 gate) and "where did the change land". Lays the arms out as one table (lawtrue / adjudicated / airside / groundside per cell), applies a stated per-cell airside CEILING (`--gate ARM`, default the first census listed, or `--gate-json FILE` for a recorded frame of record), prints the arm-vs-arm delta and, with `--bands`, the census's magnitude bands. **It measures nothing and derives no number** — every value is read verbatim from a `harness/census.py --json` artifact; a reporter that recomputes a defect count is the census-wrapper defect. Equality PASSES the gate ("may not rise"); a cell with no ceiling is reported as ungated, never as a pass. Promoted 2026-08-06 from `tmp/c8fin/mx.py` on its second use (c9feed) — promote-on-reuse; the lane copy hard-coded one round's frame as a module constant. Twin: `tests/test_census_matrix.py`. |

| `Ortho4XP/tools/census_rows_diff.py` | You have TWO `harness/census.py --rows-json` dumps (a control arm and an arm under test) and the question is WHICH rows moved, not how many. A class delta hides equal churn by construction — 200 new and 182 gone read as "+18" — and the zero-new-adjudicated-airside bar is a claim about ROWS, so it needs a row-level reader. Joins the two dumps in three labelled tiers: EXACT (same family / role pair / side, both endpoints identical to the millimetre in the patch's own layout-local metre frame), MOVED (same class, nearest surviving partner within `--tol`, default 0.50 m, each partner used once — an INFERENCE, labelled one everywhere, and quoting two tolerances is how you show the join is not doing the work), and NEW / GONE (no partner — the rows an attribution owes a mechanism for). **It derives no law and measures nothing**: every row is read verbatim out of a census dump, the census staying the only instrument that produces defect counts. REFUSES a join across different `law_true_knobs` or a different axis frame (two dumps read under different law are not one population), a class-level census JSON, and a truncated dump. `--side` / `--family` filter the REPORT, never the join. Twin: `tests/test_census_rows_diff.py` (the four tiers on a hand-built scene, the tolerance knob both ways, class isolation, endpoint-order invariance, partner-used-once, nearest-wins, exact-beats-near, every refusal). |

| `Ortho4XP/tools/pad_span_census.py` | The question is DOES THIS UNIT'S OWN DATUM FIT ITS BODIES' PADS — *how far apart do the emitted `building` pads one FOOTPRINT UNIT stands on actually stand?* — the single number owner RULINGS 2026-09-14c item 1 is accepted or refused on (spec `object-placement-spec.md` §16g (1)/(7)). No other instrument asks it: `harness/census.py` prices PAIRS OF VALUES, so an object seated 23.70 m above its own pad breaks no grade law and reports ZERO rows; `obj8_split_report.py` prints a body's anchor and its own ground but never asks whether the bodies sharing ONE unit's datum stand on pads that disagree; `role_overlap_read.py` is an AREA sweep and `role_edge_census.py` a boundary-length one. This is the unit-vs-pad reading: per unit, the `building` pads its bodies' FEET fall inside, how many bodies it holds, and the SPAN of those pads' planes, largest first. **It measures no law and counts no defects** — the pads are the emitted design surface's own `building` faces at `median(z)` over the ring, which is the plane `footprint_unit` reads through `anchor_rule.pad_plurality`, and the body→part join is the PART ID, never a proximity match (memory `canonical-identity-join`). `--over` (default 1.0 m) is the listing floor 14g stated its bar in, not a threshold with any standing. It takes either `o4_v2_placement_<ICAO>.json` or an `obj8_split_report --json` dump — both carry the same `splits` body records. Measured basis (scout `v2heca331` on the owner's 1.0.331 HECA): 17 units whose pads span > 1 m over 1,363 bodies, `fu:38:20` alone 978 bodies on 136 pads spanning 34.8 m — the unit chained on PART BOXES, and its DECK member then gave 96.20 to 1,509 bodies. Promoted 2026-09-14 from that scout's scratchpad `padspan.py` on its SECOND use (RULINGS `7e90032`, promote-on-reuse) — the 14g attribution, then lane `v2connector` round 3's before/after. Several patches are reported separately; quote it on identical options. Twin: `tests/test_pad_span_census.py` (the span IS the unit's own pads, a non-`building` face is not a pad, a unit on one pad is not a row, a body with no `unit_of` is not counted, the floor both ways, the CLI's JSON IS the library result, and this index row). |

| `Ortho4XP/tools/role_edge_census.py` | The question is WHAT SHARES AN EDGE WITH WHAT — *how many metres of a groundside shape's boundary run along AIRSIDE PAVEMENT in an emitted patch* — the single number owner RULINGS 2026-09-12c is accepted or refused on ("shapeID 81 ... cannot be groundside because it shares a long edge with an apron. Something can only be groundside if it has no connection to airside other than a service road"). No other instrument answers it: `harness/census.py` prices PAIRS OF VALUES, so a lot welded flat along 828 m of apron breaks no grade law and reports ZERO rows; `role_overlap_read.py` asks AREA overlap (what STANDS on what), which is 0 for two faces that merely share a boundary; `osm_site.py` answers one coordinate. This is the BOUNDARY-LENGTH sweep: per groundside shape its area, perimeter, inscribed radius (area / perimeter) and the metres shared with airside pavement / with `service_road`+`service_junction` / with `building`, largest first; `--min-m` (§27's `[lot] airside_edge_min_m`, default 10) and `--min-radius` (its sliver floor, default 1.0 m) split the population into SUBSTANTIVE, SLIVER and LOT-class. **It measures no law and counts no defects** — geometry, roles and the groundside partition come from the harness library (`check_grade._parse_osm`, `effective_role`, `_GROUNDSIDE_ROLES`), imported and never re-spelled (the census-wrapper precedent); defect counts come from `harness/census.py` and nowhere else. Edges are joined on NODE IDENTITY — a shared edge is two shapes listing the same node pair, exactly what the planar weld produces — never a proximity match (memory `canonical-identity-join`). Measured basis (shipped 1.0.320 LEMD): 175 groundside shapes, 105 sharing >= 10 m with airside pavement, 71 substantive (182,604 m², 34 slivers excluded), of which 13 LOT-class / 145,262 m² — the owner's shapeID 81 (`pav137`) 140.2 m of its 270.9 m perimeter, `pav125` 828.4 m. Promoted 2026-09-12 from the `v2lemd320t` scout's `census_gs.py` on its second use (RULINGS `7e90032`). Several patches are reported separately — the arm-to-arm read; quote it on identical options. **`--pad-frontage`** is the SECOND question on the same geometry and the same joins (added 2026-09-12, lane `v2frontage`, spec §28): *pad -> neighbour -> shared edge m -> STEP m*, the read owner RULINGS 2026-09-11ai-1 -> 2026-09-12r ("grade frontages only") is accepted on. No other instrument answers it either: the harness census FORGIVES a declared terrace across a shape joint (`terrace_joints_ll`), so a car park standing 3 m above the terminal it fronts prices ZERO rows — and at LEMD the owner's +3.03 m is not even a declared joint (the patch carries 4, none of them `building4`'s). Per `building` shape: each groundside neighbour (`groundside_pavement` / `service_road` / `service_junction`, `parking_lot` by its class tag), the metres of edge they SHARE by node identity, the facing-vertex pairs within `--near` (default 2.0 m) and the largest and mean SIGNED step, neighbour minus pad. The proximity read is not a shortcut: the pad-frontage relation is a proximity relation in the engine too (`[design] pad_frontage_m` 3.0, owner RULINGS 2026-09-10ax (1)) and `building4` / `pav124` share not one node while standing 0.71-1.50 m apart. `--min-step` (default 0.05 m) is the listing floor. Measured basis (shipped 1.0.321 LEMD): ONE pad with a groundside step >= 0.10 m — `building4`, `pav124` +3.03 / +2.67 and `route6` +0.38. Twin: `tests/test_role_edge_census.py` (the shared edge IS the node-identity join, the airside-pavement set excludes `building`, service-road metres are reported apart, the sliver split, prices-no-law, the pad-frontage step across a proximity gap and across a welded edge, and this index row). |

| `Ortho4XP/tools/void_census.py` | The question is about ENCLAVE TOPOLOGY on a shipped patch: which regions does airside pavement completely surround, which of them have a tunnel/bridge ESCAPE, and what is sitting inside them. Reads back exactly the geometry the enclave region law computes (`auto_patch/enclaves.py`). `--union` selects WHICH union, because the law has two and they answer different questions: `surround` (default) is airside ∪ BUILDINGS, the set published as `layout.airside_enclaves` and the CLASSIFIER's question ("is this ground airside-interior?"); `pavement` is airside pavement only, which is the GAP LAW's own detection union and therefore the scope of the adjacent-ground BAND KEEP-OUT (`enclaves.enclave_band_keepout_union`). The distinction is load-bearing and was measured: buildings standing in HECA's 3.4 km² infield subdivide it into pocket-width components in the `surround` union while the gap law holds it as ONE wide region and declines it on width, so scoping the keep-out by the wrong union deleted 152,734 m² of Annex 14 §3.4.11-13 graded strip. The union is stamped into every report — two unions are two populations. Reports per void its area, perimeter, minimum-rotated-rect SHORT SIDE and POCKET flag (short side ≤ the gap law's own `GAP_FILL_MAX_WIDTH_M`, the class the ruled gap ring + spine treatment covers; under `--union pavement` that flag IS the band keep-out's membership test), the escapes, whether the gap treatment emitted a face there, the per-role/ref contents, the retaining-wall inventory with way ids, and the BARE GROUND remainder carrying no shape at all — the 87.6 % that made the shape-scoped G-ENCLAVE predicate structurally blind. `--bands` adds the ADJACENT-GROUND inventory beside the topology: band and `adjacent_ground_wall` way counts and areas, split by where each way SITS — inside a POCKET no-escape void (the keep-out's own territory), inside another no-escape void, or outside every void — each way in exactly one column, the columns summing to the total. Reach for it whenever a band-area delta is about to be quoted: the total alone cannot tell a keep-out that removed band inside pocket voids from one that also took ground nothing owns, and that is precisely the failure the ratified scoping fixes. **It measures no law and derives no defect count**: grade defects come from `harness/census.py` and nowhere else, and the role vocabulary plus the escape set are IMPORTED from `auto_patch.enclaves` rather than re-typed (the census-wrapper precedent). Parses with the harness library's own reader (`check_grade._parse_osm`) in the builder's anchor frame from the axes sidecar, so this tool and the census read one geometry; without a sidecar the topology is unchanged and lat/lon are simply not reported. FRAME: emitted geometry is post-decimation and post `_separate_groundside_from_airside`, so a void reads slightly larger than the in-build region and a groundside shape inside it reads pulled back from the rim; a real-DEM patch is never comparable with a constant-DEM one. The in-build predicate also honours the `is_bridge` SHAPE FLAG, which `to_osm` does not emit — so this reader sees the four escape ROLES and no more (stated by the tool itself). Promoted 2026-08-07 from `tmp/enclave_attrib/void_census.py` on its second use (promote-on-reuse); the lane copy carried its own patch reader and a hand-typed role list. Twin: `tests/test_void_census.py`. |

| `Ortho4XP/tools/seat_feet_census.py` | THE DRAPE RESIDUAL AT EVERY PLACEMENT'S FEET (RULINGS 2026-09-09ac (3); the placement reading 11e (3), spec §7/§9) — `--placement-plan o4_v2_placement_<ICAO>.json` with `--mesh` (a built mesh) or `--graded` (the emitted design surface, for a dry run with no tile built): per placement of the plan's own rows, `surface(foot) − (surface(anchor) + y_foot)`, the |Δ| histogram (<0.3 / 0.3-1 / 1-3 / >3 m), the same by class, the worst N with lat/lon, and §13's elevated-body / footless-carrier bars. Feet are read from the AUTHORED pack (`.anchor_bak` when one exists). THE SEAT-RESULT MODE IS DELETED (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12s, spec §8) — the name is kept because the INDEX row, `obj8_split_report` and the twins address it by it. Writes nothing to the pack. §17 THE COCKPIT BLOCK (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12x/12y, lane `v2cockpit`) is printed FIRST, before the §14 bars: the §15 floats, the §16a (2) refusal set's `ground_off`, the §16b own-ground floats and the §16c torn seams classified CRITICAL VISUAL at `[cockpit] visual_m` 0.5 m (with the worst named by resource AND coordinate) or REPORT under it, from `placement_census.cockpit_block` — the SAME `[cockpit]` law keys the terrain census reads, one frame for both stages. `split_tol_m` 0.3 stays a PARTITION choice and its `body wider than its terrain group` count is REPORT whatever its size. CRITICAL MOTION is named as an instrument limit rather than printed as a zero HERE: §17's motion reading needs the graded face ROLE under each foot, and this tool hands the block none — `obj8_split_report.py` is the entry that takes it (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12am (2), lane `v2objmotion`). §16e (owner RULINGS 2026-09-13k, lane `v2othhdatums`): `--placement-plan --mesh` WAS BROKEN — it passed its bbox as `(lat, lon)` to `MeshElevationSampler`, which takes `(min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat)`, so at OTHH it asked for a box at lon 25.2 / lat 51.6 and the sampler raised `no mesh triangles inside ... — wrong tile?`; the one place the two orders meet is now `plan_bounds()` and a twin holds it end to end over the sampler's own mesh fixture. The report also prints `§16e bodies on a DATUM` (a crest plate / a deck top) as its own class and EXCLUDES them from §13's `elevated bodies as own files` bar: a datum body's `y_zero` is +5 … +10 m by construction, and counting it there reported the law as the defect (OTHH 0 -> 10 -> 0 with the class printed apart). §16e (3) (Fable 2026-09-13, RULINGS 2026-09-13v, lane `v2bridgecontact`): the report also prints THE BRIDGE FAMILY block (`airport/bridge_family.census_bridges` / `census_bridges_lines`, re-exported through `placement_census`, the same call `obj8_split_report` makes over the same plan shape) — per `Bridge_NN` the deck's own body's world DECK TOP against the land under that bridge's own written geometry (`|deck top - highest land|`, bar `[cockpit] visual_m` 0.5 m), the PER-PLACEMENT zero spread (`max - min` of `surface_z - y_zero` over one placement's bodies; `Bridge_02_CLUTTER_007` is six piers of ONE solid), the CROSS-BRIDGE carriers (a body whose `merged_into` names a file of another bridge, bar 0) and how many bodies publish `bridge_of` and agree with the resource's own tag. The `Bridge_NN` axis is the CENSUS's, never the law's — §16e (3) exists because the name does not name a bridge — so the agreement count is the instrument's own check on the derived relation. Measured on the app's 1.0.326 OTHH frame: `Bridge_01` deck top 3.23 -> 3.96 and `Bridge_04`/`Bridge_05` KEPT -> 3.96 (all three |deck top - land| 0.00, PASS), cross-bridge carriers 2 (unchanged — the bind and the filter are refuted and deleted, see `bridge_family`'s module doc). |

## Standing discipline (unchanged for every lane; the long form is `.claude/agents/lane.md`)

- Worktree: `tools/harness/lane_worktree.sh up <lane> <base sha>`; branch `claude/<lane>`.
  `git merge main` FIRST if main has moved past the base sha.
- `Ortho4XP/venv/bin/python tools/blast.py <file>` before editing each source
  file; a file past 1,000 lines is a warning to reconsider its architecture (split by
  responsibility when it no longer fits; past 1,500 split before merging — owner 13bz).
- ONE closing build through the harness (v2 is the only engine, RULINGS
  2026-09-13au — there is no `--engine` flag); base arms cut with
  `git archive <sha> src`, never another live checkout.
- NEVER write `/Users/noah/XPTerrainBuilderData` or `/Users/noah/X-Plane 12/Custom Scenery/`;
  no `--refresh-data`; every run prints `[guard] shared repo UNCHANGED`;
  lane-local `O4_DSF_CACHE_DIR` / `O4_AIRPORT_MOD_CACHE_DIR` under your scratchpad.
- Any wait loop is bounded (`timeout N` or `$SECONDS`); prefer foreground.
- Suite from `Ortho4XP/` twice: `venv/bin/python -m pytest -q --no-header -p no:cacheprovider -rfE tests/auto_patch_v2 tests/test_harness.py tests/test_role_edge_census.py`.
- Attempt cap two per rule; a bar that moves backwards twice → delete the code, report the measurement.
- Consumer census (RULINGS 2026-08-30l) in the spec MEASURED block before any consumer is edited.
- Extend tools, never fork; INDEX row + twin for any new option. Do NOT merge into main; do NOT write RULINGS.
- Read law with `tools/docq.py spec '§N'`, `tools/docq.py ruling 13xx`, `tools/docq.py index <name>`;
  find captures with `tools/harness/frames.py list [ICAO]`; register yours when done.
- REPORT: branch + sha; per-bar before → after with the frame named; what you did NOT do;
  intent questions with their measurement; files touched.
