## Task

The pad derivation leaves the airside vertex set alone; the trend is fitted on airside only (RULINGS 14as (i))

## The brief

THE PAD DERIVATION MUST LEAVE THE AIRSIDE VERTEX SET ALONE (RULINGS 14as (i)). Measured by lane v2staged: with `pad_from_cluster = true` at HECA, 268 airside vertices are GONE and 93 NEW, apron faces 844 → 841, and the body datum / 2-D trend are refitted — so the airside PROBLEM changes when pads are derived, and no solver arrangement can then make the airside invariant. Read `tools/docq.py spec --object '§16g (10)'` (the (5) clip, (7) leaves, (8) rigid core), `tools/docq.py ruling 14as 14al 14aj 14ah`. Sites: the derived pad polygon (`classify/evidence._cluster_pads` / `_pads`, `geom/cluster_outline.py`) and where it enters the planar arrangement (`planar/overlay.build_arrangement`, the pad clip by airside faces), the body datum / trend fit (`constraints/` — find where the apron 2-D trend and the `body_datum` planes are fitted and which vertex population they read). Rules to implement at the derivation: (1) a pad clipped by airside SHARES the airside face's existing rim vertices along the clip line and adds NO vertex to any airside face (snap the clip line to the airside ring's existing vertices / edges; if a pad edge would split an airside edge, the pad edge moves to the nearest existing airside vertex — the pad yields, never the airside); (2) the body datum and the 2-D trend are fitted on the airside population alone — pads never enter the fit (they read the fitted plane); (3) a census counter `airside_vertices_changed_by_pads` (gone/new vs the pads-off arrangement) must read 0. Measure on the HECA capture: arm `pad_from_cluster` and diff the airside vertex set and the apron face list against the OFF arm — 268/93/844→841 today → 0/0/844; then with `staged_solve = true` the airside solved values identical to the OFF arm to 1e-6 (the invariant, by construction once (1)–(2) hold and the hard set settles — lane v2settle). Twins: a synthetic apron + a derived pad overlapping it: the apron's vertex set and face count unchanged with pads on vs off; the trend plane identical. Files: `classify/evidence.py`, `geom/cluster_outline.py`, `planar/overlay.py` (the pad clip only), the trend/datum fit site in `constraints/` (name it). NOT yours: `solve/` (lane v2settle), `airport/`, `emit/`, `planar/basins.py`, `structures.py`. No build unless the capture cannot answer (then ONE HECA).

## Bars

- HECA capture, pads ON vs OFF: airside vertices gone/new 268/93 → 0/0; apron faces 844 → 844; the body datum / trend planes identical (coefficients to 1e-9).
- With `staged_solve = true` (on top of lane v2settle when it lands, else on today's solve): airside solved values ON vs OFF identical to 1e-6 (name the residual if the hard set is still unsettled — that is v2settle's).
- The terminal at 30.1279552, 31.403143 still on its pad (72.6 ± 0.02) with pads ON.
- Suite twice.

## Spec (object-placement) §16g (10)

### §16g (10) (4)–(5) WHAT CHAINS, AND A DERIVED PAD NEVER TAKES AIRSIDE GROUND (Fable 2026-09-14; RULINGS 2026-09-14ah) — lane `v2padcluster`

MEASURED (lane r2, HECA): with pads derived from clusters as hard flat
regions, 502,561 m² of new pad (94,795 m² from apron) moved 13,637 of
21,534 airside vertices (runway 1,110, worst 4.38 m) and put the terminal at
+10.83 m; the T3 district stayed ONE cluster of 9,334 bodies / 541,200 m²
because its footed bodies genuinely touch through the authored ground
slabs.

4. WHAT CHAINS.  Only WALLED bodies link a cluster.  A thin body — floor
   slab, plate, deck, canopy, road, apron object; solid height <
   `chain_min_height_m` (2.5 m), or classed deck/plate/pavement by the
   object stage — is a LEAF: seated on its own ground or carrier, never a
   link between two walled bodies.
5. A DERIVED PAD NEVER TAKES AIRSIDE GROUND.  The pad polygon is the
   cluster's outline clipped by every airside face; a cluster wholly on
   airside pavement gets no pad.  A cluster whose outline is in more than
   one piece is SPLIT at the pieces (each a cluster with its own pad).

BARS: HECA airside vertices moved > 0.02 m = 0; the terminal at 30.1279552,
31.403143 at its pad 72.50; `pad_cluster_mismatch` 0; the T3 district
resolved into its buildings (count, largest cluster's area named);
constraints ≤ +10 %; KCLT BUILD with outlines — `building80` 221.44 ± 0.02
and the terminal's members' seats unchanged; SPJC 19.56 dry.

### §16g (10) (6) A PAD SHARING AN EDGE WITH AIRSIDE WELDS TO IT (owner RULINGS 2026-09-14ai) — lane `v2padcluster`

A `building` pad that shares an edge with an airside face takes the airside
face's solved level along that edge — no step — and its plane meets it
within the pad's own slope cap; the airside is the datum (airside is king),
the pad never pulls it.  A pad that cannot meet its airside edge within cap
is `pad_airside_weld` (CRITICAL), never a terrace step.  The cluster seated
on such a pad follows the welded level.  BAR: every airside-sharing pad at
HECA and KCLT welded (step along the shared edge ≤ `hard_tol_m`), named with
its airside face.

### §16g (10) (7)–(8) LEAVES GET NO PAD; A PAD BENDS TO THE AIRSIDE AT ITS RIM (Fable 2026-09-14; RULINGS 2026-09-14aj) — lane `v2padcluster`

MEASURED (r3): (4)/(5) hold, yet 345,016 m² of new hard-flat pad beside the
apron moved 17,482 airside vertices — a shared vertex is one unknown.  A
derived pad cannot be (a) one hard plane, (b) welded to the apron along its
rim and (c) forbidden to move the apron all at once.
7. A derived pad is minted for a WALLED cluster only; a leaf (slab, plate,
   deck, canopy, road; §16g (10) (4)) seats on its own ground and mints no
   pad.
8. (a) is dropped AT THE RIM: a pad is flat (cap 0) across its interior and
   non-airside rim; along an airside-sharing edge its rim vertices are
   one-way followers of the airside (airside leads), and the plate meets
   them within the pad's slope ceiling (1 %) — a bent skirt, never a step.
   Twins asserting a two-sided cap-0 plate at an airside edge are re-founded.
BARS: HECA airside moved 0; the terminal body on its walled cluster's pad
within 0.02 m, the pad within 1 % of the airside it touches, its cut/fill vs
the disarmed ground named; `pad_cluster_mismatch` 0; `pad_airside_weld` 0;
constraints ≤ +10 %; KCLT build at the final tree (the terminal pad's weld
named); SPJC build carrying heights (19.56 ± 0.02).

### §16g (10) (8) REFINED — RIGID CORE, ONE-WAY SKIRT (Fable 2026-09-14; RULINGS 2026-09-14al) — lane `v2padcluster`

MEASURED (r4): a whole-plate one-way form leaves the plate no rigid
relation and it collapses; a two-sided ceiling row on the airside-sharing
pairs holds the plate but still pulls 14,263 airside vertices (worst 4.55
m).  So: the pad's vertices farther than `pad_skirt_m` (25 m) from any
airside-sharing edge form a cap-0 RIGID CORE; the SKIRT BAND within
`pad_skirt_m` follows the airside ONE-WAY within the pad slope ceiling —
the airside leads and is never pulled; the core stays a plate.  BARS: HECA
airside moved > 0.02 m = 0; the terminal at its pad (72.60); `pad_airside_
weld` 0 or each named; KCLT `building80` weld re-read; SPJC viaduct re-read.

### §16g (10) (4)–(6) MEASURED, ROUND 3 (lane `v2padcluster`, 2026-09-14; branch `claude/v2padcluster`)

**WHAT CARRIES THE T3 CHAIN, MEASURED FIRST (the round's first order).**
Per body of the largest cluster (`unit:43`, 9,334 bodies / 9,333 touch
edges), how many cluster edges pass through it:

| resource | edges | parts | solid extent | `base_y` | area |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `T3_4.obj` | **1,822** | 1 | **0.00 m** | 15.73 | 1,161 m² |
| `T3_4.obj` | **1,772** | 1 | **0.00 m** | 15.73 | 1,161 m² |
| `metal_titles.obj` | 1,531 | 58 | 23.51 m | 3.73 | 25,477 m² |
| `Plastic.obj` | 1,165 | 238 | 22.07 m | 6.09 | 18,553 m² |
| `floor.obj` | 996 | 12 | 6.53 m | −0.63 | 14,415 m² |
| `door.obj` | 468 | 1 | 0.00 m | −0.46 | 589 m² |
| `concrete_3.obj` | 219 | 1 | 0.00 m | −1.84 | 17,383 m² |
| `strip_concrete.obj` | 41 | 1 | 0.00 m | −0.17 | 1,289 m² |

Two single-component CEILING PLATES carry **3,594 of the district's
9,333 edges** between them; six `T3_4.obj` bodies carry 3,598 endpoints,
`black_glass.obj` contributes 366 bodies all at extent 0.00, and
`concrete_3.obj` is 13cs's 17,383 m² ground slab.  **The district is held
together by its floor and its ceiling**, exactly as 14ah read it.

**THE ARMS.**  DISARM `v2padclusterHECAdisarm` (`97a2267cfc28`, 462.1 s)
against LANE `v2padclusterHECA4` (`cbefb8edcacb`, 384.4 s, ledger
`72fb36419b42`), both `[guard] shared repo UNCHANGED`.  `v2padclusterHECA3`
is byte-identical in its design surface (same `body_sha`) — the object-
stage half of (4) moves no vertex, which is itself the proof that the
unit rule and the cluster rule are separable.

| bar | DISARM | round 2 | round 3 | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| clusters | — | 1,954 | **4,278** | — |
| largest cluster over the pad threshold | — | 541,200 m² / 9,334 bodies | **171,086 m² / 1 body** | **(4) MET — the T3 district is resolved** |
| `pad_cluster_mismatch` (bar 0) | 33 | 44 | **27** | MISSED |
| `pad_airside_weld` (bar 0, new) | 16 | — | **24** | MISSED, and WORSE |
| **airside vertices moved > 0.02 m (bar 0)** | — | 13,637 of 21,534 | **17,482 of 29,465, worst 12.15 m; the runway 856 of 3,426, worst 3.14 m** | **MISSED** |
| `building` pad area | 867,173 m² | 1,369,935 | **1,212,189** | the clip gave 157,746 m² back |
| apron area | 2,935,484 m² | 2,841,363 | **3,012,902** | **(5) MET — the pads no longer eat the apron** |
| the terminal 30.1279552 31.403143, SURFACE (bar 72.50) | 72.07 | 82.90 | **80.94** | MISSED |
| the terminal's BODY off its own ground | — | `T3_49 b4` +7.66 m | **`T3_49 b3` +0.15 m, WITHIN 0.3** | **MET — it left the 52-member unit** |
| constraints stage (bar ≤ +10 %) | 83.46 s | +57 % | **129.67 s, +55 %** | MISSED |
| law-true census total | 62,116 | — | **77,288** | reported |
| suite | | | 1,475 passed, twice | MET |

**(5) WORKS ON THE MAP AND NOT ON THE SOLVE, AND THAT IS THE ROUND'S
FINDING.**  Clipping the pads out of airside did what it says: the apron
GAINS 77,418 m² instead of losing 94,795, and no pad overlaps a runway or
a taxiway.  The airside still moves 17,482 vertices.  The mechanism is
not overlap — it is the WELD: 345,016 m² of new hard-flat pad now sits
BESIDE the apron along its whole perimeter, and a shared vertex is ONE
unknown (09-01g, contact = value), so the pad's flat rows and the apron's
own rows are peers at every boundary node.  Clipping moved the conflict
from the interior to the edge; it did not remove it.

**(6) AS A CONSTRAINT WAS ATTEMPTED TWICE AND BOTH FORMS ARE REFUTED BY
MEASUREMENT.**  14ai's sentence — "the airside is the datum, the pad
never pulls it" — has two implementations and this lane measured both:

1. WITHDRAW the shared vertices from the pad's flat plate.  The pad then
   has no plate at its rim and loses its own law: the §30 twin's pad
   tilted to **2.6 % against a 1 % HARD ceiling**, and a pad between two
   pavements half a percent apart stopped being flat.  Narrowing the
   withdrawal to the cap-0 target and leaving the 1 % ceiling the whole
   rim did not save it (4 ruled twins still red).
2. Make those rows ONE-WAY with the airside vertex as LEADER (09-10l's
   own shape, a new head in `one_way_rulings` + `pad_flat_rulings`).
   **13 ruled twins go red**, including the plate's own two-sidedness
   (§30 "every rim pair priced, contacts included") and §28's frontage
   direction.

Both are rewrites of laws this lane does not own, so NEITHER SHIPPED.
What shipped is (6)'s CENSUS — `pad_airside_weld`, CRITICAL, computed
from the patch by node identity — and it reads **16 pads at DISARM and 24
with the derived pads**.  The step ACROSS a welded edge is 0 by
construction and is not what it measures; what it measures is the pad
pulled out of plane at the edge, which is the thing the owner's sentence
forbids and which is now visible for the first time.

**THE CONFLICT, STATED ONCE.**  A derived pad is (a) one hard plane, (b)
welded to the apron along its whole rim, and (c) forbidden to move the
apron.  Any two of the three can hold; all three cannot, and the three
are §30's pad law, 09-01g's weld and 14ai's airside datum respectively.
**STOP-and-report: nothing further is armed.**  The lever the owner must
choose among: drop (a) for pads that share an airside edge (the pad
becomes a level, not a plane, at that edge — and its 1 % ceiling with
it); drop (b) (a derived pad stands OFF the apron by a declared joint,
§23, and shares no vertex); or drop (c) and accept a bounded airside
movement with a stated cap.

**KCLT, AND THE REF IS NOT A HANDLE.**  `v2padclusterKCLT3` (rc 0,
274.2 s, `d19ae4797bc4`, guard UNCHANGED; no ledger key — the tree moved
during the run).  Read BY COORDINATE at 13bo's own site (35.2191877,
−80.9426007), because `building{N}` is an ORDINAL and the derived pads
renumber every later one: the terminal pad is **221.46 → 220.56 m**
(−0.90), 865 → 483 vertices, spread 1.07 → 0.51.  The bar was unchanged
within `hard_tol_m`: **MISSED by 0.90 m**, and the members' seats follow
it.  `building80` as a REF now names a 16-vertex pad elsewhere — quoting
it across these arms would have reported 3.77 m of pure renumbering.

**SPJC IS INERT AND SAYS SO.**  The registered frame
(`SPJC_20260913T214930`) carries no `Part.height_m`, so (4) stands down
by its own clause and the units are byte-identical — 4 units, `fu:0:0`
with 484 bodies / 24 members including `xp11_007` and `xp11_010`.  The
19.56 viaduct is untouched BY CONSTRUCTION, not by measurement; an SPJC
build carrying heights is OWED, as is a KCLT one at the final tree.

### §16g (10) (7)–(8) MEASURED, ROUND 4 (lane `v2padcluster`, 2026-09-14; branch `claude/v2padcluster`)

**THE ARMS.**  DISARM `v2padclusterHECAdisarm` (`97a2267cfc28`) against
LANE `v2padclusterHECA5` (rc 0, 420.6 s, `1112755a1db9`, ledger
`85c18b3071e6`); KCLT `v2padclusterKCLT4` (rc 0, 259.0 s, `2fa924a012cc`,
ledger `dca6d7449633`); SPJC `v2padclusterSPJC4` (rc 0, 82.1 s,
`7f9b9659d13c`, no ledger — 23 external-candidate deltas in the window,
another lane's).  All four `[guard] shared repo UNCHANGED`.  Suite
**1,474 passed / 1 skipped, twice**.

**(7) LEAVES GET NO PAD, MEASURED.**  Of HECA's 1,380,739 m² of cluster
outline, **359,152 m² in 1,518 pads are LEAVES** (no walled body) and
**175,708 m² in 821 more are walled but under `cluster_pad_min_m2`** —
together **39 %** of the pad area that sat beside the apron.  The emitted
pad area falls 1,212,189 → **1,091,467 m²** (DISARM 867,173).  The same
population is used by `classify` (which mints) and by the census (which
judges), so the mismatch family can never report a cluster that was never
given a pad.

| bar | DISARM | round 3 | **round 4** | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **airside moved > 0.02 m (bar 0)** | — | 17,482 of 29,465, worst 12.15 m | **14,263 of 29,783, worst 4.55 m** | MISSED, worst −63 % |
| the RUNWAY alone | — | 856 of 3,426, worst 3.14 m | **1,021 of 3,426, worst 0.41 m** | worst −87 % |
| terminal 30.1279552 31.403143, SURFACE (bar 72.50) | 72.07 | 80.94 | **72.60** | **MET (+0.10)** |
| the terminal BODY | — | on `building11`, own ground +7.50 m | **`T3_concrete_white b4` on WALLED cluster pad `building298` at 72.62 via `fu:38:96@cluster_pad` (18 members), own ground +0.08 m; `metal b8` +0.05, worst foot +0.21 WITHIN 0.3** | ~MET (0.08 vs the 0.02 bar) |
| the terminal pad's CUT/FILL vs the DISARM ground | 72.07 | +8.87 | **+0.55 m of FILL**, cluster `fu:38:96@cluster_pad`, pad `building298` | named |
| `pad_cluster_mismatch` (bar 0) | 33 | 27 | **14** | MISSED |
| `pad_airside_weld` (bar 0) | **3** (worst 0.085 m) | — | **16** (worst 1.135 m, `building4 → pav1` over 51.5 m) | MISSED |
| constraints (bar ≤ +10 %) | 83.46 s | +55 % | **96.57 s, +15.7 %** | MISSED |
| law-true census total | 62,103 | 77,288 (+24 %) | **63,904 (+2.9 %)** | reported |

**WHERE THE CONSTRAINT COST GOES.**  `pad_flats` itself is 10.6 → **2.5
s** (the skirt prices fewer cap-0 pairs), and the LP is SMALLER than
round 3's (245,680 → 212,368 rows, 34,448 → 32,872 columns).  What
remains is the pad population: 823,018 → **838,816** `diffs`, i.e. 15,798
more difference rows over 1,091,467 m² of pad against 867,173.  The
residual +15.7 % is the price of the pads themselves, not of (8).

**(8)'s ONE-WAY CLAUSE IS REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT, AND ONLY THAT CLAUSE.**
14aj asks for the airside-sharing rim vertices to be ONE-WAY FOLLOWERS.
Built that way, a plate whose every binding is one-way has no rigid
relation to anything in the first lag round and does not chase back: the
§30 twin's pad collapsed from **703.56 to 640.89 m**.  09-10l's one-way
precedent is a LEVEL row — a mean against a leader band — which leaves
the PLATE holding the pad rigid; a whole plate one-way leaves nothing.
What shipped is the rest of (8): a pair with an end the pad shares with
airside is priced at the pad's own **slope ceiling** instead of the cap-0
flat target, so the pad is flat across its interior and its non-airside
rim and BENDS to meet the pavement it touches.  HECA: **8,967 skirt
rows**, 0 pairs dropped, **30 pads wholly inside pavement** kept their
two-sided plate (the OSM pad-in-an-apron class, which the skirt would
leave with no law at all).  That alone took the airside's worst move from
12.15 m to 4.55 m and the runway's from 3.14 to 0.41.

**THE TWINS, RE-FOUNDED AND NAMED (14aj's own instruction).**

| twin | asserted | now asserts |
|---|---|---|
| `test_constraints::test_strip_families_and_pads` | a cap-0 `Diff` over EVERY rim pair at `pad_flat` | the cap set is `{0, pad_slope_max}`; every ceiling-capped FLAT row has an airside end and every cap-0 row has none; the ceiling pass is still one row per pair over the whole rim (the ROW SET is unchanged) |
| `test_v2padlevel::test_a_pad_between_two_pavements_..._tiers_neither` | the pad's MEAN lies between its two frontages | the pad MEETS each frontage (a shared vertex IS that pavement's vertex, 09-01g) and its tilt stays inside the 1 % ceiling.  The bracket only ever held because a flat plate pinned at both edges must sit between them |
| `test_v2frontage::test_the_only_channel_left_is_the_two_way_apron_edge_ramp_law` | the two-way apron-edge ramp moves the pad < 0.05 m | the same claim, re-measured at **0.172 m**: a looser pad, the same channel, still downward, still the ramp's |
| `test_v2clusterpad` / `test_v2padcluster` fixtures | a cluster with no `walled` count | `_Cl` / `_Cluster` carry `walled`, because (7) drops a leaf |
| `verify.census.NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | — | gains `pad_cluster_mismatch` / `pad_airside_weld`: both are the CENSUS's and `verify` has no reader, so the lockstep twin must not expect one (CYXY v1 read 7 weld rows against v2's 0) |
| `test_v2padcluster::…pad_airside_weld…` | a least-squares plane residual against `hard_tol_m` | the SHARED vertex against its own pad's other vertices at `pad_slope_max·d`.  The first reading measured the bend (8) ALLOWS — HECA read 16 rows at DISARM and 36 with the skirt, the instrument counting the law working.  At the cap: DISARM **3**, LANE **16** |

**KCLT, AND THE −0.53 m IS THE WELD, NAMED.**  The terminal pad at
13bo's own coordinate (35.2191877, −80.9426007) is `building80`, 850
vertices, median **221.46 → 220.93** (round 3: 220.56), spread 1.07 →
**3.77**.  It shares **743 nodes with the apron `pav14`** (z 220.04 …
223.81) and 51 more with `pav118` — so the step across the weld is 0 by
construction and the pad's 3.77 m spread IS the apron's own fall across
the edge it is welded to.  The bar (unchanged within `hard_tol_m`) is
MISSED by 0.53 m and the movement is the weld's, which is what 14aj said
would make it lawful — **the owner's read is the acceptance.**  `pad_
airside_weld` 25 rows, worst `building80 → pav14` **1.384 m over 11.6 m**:
the pad could not reach that edge even bending at 1 %.

**SPJC, BUILT WITH HEIGHTS, AND THE VIADUCT MOVES.**  `xp11_007__b0` is
on pad `building7` at **20.07** in unit `fu:0:3@cluster_pad` of **6
members** — 13df's reading was **19.5604** in `fu:0:0@cluster_pad` of 24.
The leaf rule split the 24-member unit into 6 and the derived pad stands
0.51 m above it: **MISSED by 0.51 m**, and `building7` is also SPJC's
worst weld row (0.970 m over 20.0 m against `pav46`).

**THE SEVEN HECA BUILDINGS, AS FAR AS THE IDENTITIES REACH.**  A body
INDEX is as unstable as a pad ref — the cut renumbers bodies exactly as
the derived pads renumber `building{N}` — so only the bodies whose index
survived both arms can be quoted: `T3_38 b1` (14g's 160) `fu:43:7386@
cluster_pad` of 20 members on `building53` at 98.02, own ground **−6.70 →
+0.04 m** on `building160` in a 2-member unit; `T3_38 b4` (170) own
ground −0.02 → **−0.02**, WITHIN 0.3 both arms; `T3_38 b3` (147) median

worst **−0.33**.  `building_texture_4 b7/b8` and `building_texture_3
b29/b31` do not exist under those indices in either arm and were NOT
read.

**STOP-and-report.**  Three bars moved a long way (the terminal is MET,
the runway's worst move is 0.41 m, the cost is +15.7 %) and three are
still missed — airside 14,263, `pad_cluster_mismatch` 14,
`pad_airside_weld` 16.  The remaining airside movement is no longer the
pad pulling its own edge: it is the pad's SKIRT, bending at up to 1 %
over hundreds of metres, plus the 30 pads that keep a two-sided plate.
The lever the owner must choose among is now narrow: (i) a skirt WIDTH —
the bend is allowed only within N metres of the shared edge and the pad
is flat beyond it; (ii) the one-way form with a RIGID SEED (the plate
keeps a cap-0 core over its non-airside vertices and only the skirt band
follows), which is the form that did not collapse in the twin; or (iii)
accept a bounded airside movement with the 0.41 m runway figure as the
stated cap.

### §16g (10) (8) REFINED — MEASURED, ROUND 5 (lane `v2padcluster`, 2026-09-14; branch `claude/v2padcluster`)

**THREE ARMS, ONE TREE, LAW VALUES ONLY**, all against DISARM
`v2padclusterHECAdisarm`, all `[guard] shared repo UNCHANGED`:

| arm | `pad_skirt_m` | wall | `body_sha` | ledger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| round 4's scope (the shared vertices) | — | 420.6 s | `1112755a1db9` | `85c18b3071e6` |

**14al's ONE-WAY CLAUSE IS REFUTED FOR THE THIRD TIME, ON A THIRD
SCOPE.**  14al adds the cap-0 rigid core precisely so round 4's collapse
cannot recur, and it does not recur — with a core the pad holds.  It is
still not STABLE: built with the band following the airside one-way,
§28's own frontage row — which its twin proves moves NOTHING — moved the
pad **0.12 m**, and at CYXY the census and the engine's verify came apart
on `mid_edge_step` (**77 against 14**), i.e. the lag leaves residuals the
two readers do not share.  A one-way row is LAGGED; a pad bound to the
airside only by lagged rows has nothing holding it inside a round.
09-10l's precedent is ONE level row per pad against a leader band, with
the plate still rigid underneath — a whole band of them is a different
thing.  The band therefore ships TWO-SIDED at the pad's slope ceiling.

**AND THE 25 m WIDTH IS REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT TOO.**  It is WORSE on
every airside bar — airside 10,048 → 10,683, the runway 1,021 → 1,394 and
its worst 0.410 → 0.570 m, `pad_airside_weld` 16 → 21 and its worst 1.135
→ 2.42 m, law-true 63,904 → 66,771 — and buys only the terminal body
+0.08 → +0.00 m.  A wider band softens more of the pad, and a softer pad
moves more of the apron inside the same ceiling.  `pad_skirt_m` keeps
25.0 as its documented design value and **ships at 0**, which is NOT "no
skirt" but the airside-SHARED vertices alone.

**WHAT 14al DID BUY, AND IT IS THE BEST ARM.**  Its other half — WITHDRAW
the two-sided ceiling row over a pair of two airside-shared vertices —
is what the shipped arm adds to round 4, and it is worth **4,008 dropped
pairs**: airside 10,048 → **9,573**, the runway 1,021 → **885** and its
worst 0.410 → **0.390 m**, law-true 66,771 → 64,844.  The pad no longer
has any two-sided row between two vertices the airside already owns.
Counters published per build: `pad_flats.airside_skirt_rows` 4,959,
`both_skirt_dropped` 4,008, `pads_core_only` 74, `pads_wholly_in_the_band`
**30** — those 30 are the pads with no plate left (the OSM
pad-in-an-apron class), which keep their two-sided plate; at the 25 m
band that count is 55 and is the answer to "how many pads are skirt
only".

**THE 14 `pad_cluster_mismatch` ROWS, ATTRIBUTED — ONE CLASS.**  12
`cluster_spans_pads` + 2 `pad_spans_clusters`, and every one is the SAME
defect: **the cluster piece and the emitted pad ref are cut in different
places.**  The cluster is cut by `geom.cluster_outlines` (the closed
outline's connected components, then the airside clip — which is why the
ids carry `/k`: `unit:43#16/0`, `/1`, `/3`), and the pad ref is cut again
downstream by `classify/evidence._pads` (the runway difference, the
boundary gate, `min_area`, §22.2's skirt drop, and the separately-unioned
FALLBACK footprints, one of which landing inside a cluster piece splits
it).  `building19` is claimed by `unit:43#16/0` AND `/1` — two pieces of
ONE cluster over one pad, the two cutters disagreeing about where the cut
is.  TO REACH 0: a cluster piece must be minted as ONE part and never
re-cut — `_pads` must not subdivide it, and a fallback footprint landing
inside one must be absorbed rather than mint its own ref.  NOT ARMED
(the round's attempts are spent).

**THE COST, NAMED.**  Constraints 83.46 → **109.69 s (+31.4 %)**, over
the +20 % the round accepted.  It is not the skirt: `pad_flats` runs in
2.6 s and the LP is SMALLER than round 3's (222,546 rows against
245,680).  It is the PAD POPULATION — 823,018 → **830,023** `diffs` over
1,091,467 m² of derived pad against DISARM's 867,173 — plus the per-pad
band walk, which is O(rim × shared) per pad and is the one piece of this
round's own work in the number.

**KCLT AND SPJC STAND ON THEIR ROUND-4 FRAMES.**  The one-way skirt is
not in the shipped law, so nothing it would have changed there was built;
the two-sided withdrawal changes the design surface, so the KCLT weld
(the terminal pad 221.46 → 220.93, 743 nodes shared with apron `pav14`)
and the SPJC viaduct (20.07 on `building7` in a 6-member unit against
13df's 19.56) are as round 4 measured them and were NOT re-built this
round — **owed**.

## RULINGS

## 2026-09-14as v2staged + v2padcluster MERGED with BOTH mechanisms OFF (`pad_from_cluster = false`, `staged_solve = false`): main's surface is byte-unchanged; the airside is not yet invariant under pads — two prerequisites named

Lane `v2staged` @ 65351424 (on `claude/v2padcluster` a3185dbb; HECA
arms `v2stagedHECAoff` = r5's shipped `18e51b7d084e` and the staged
FINAL `266b56b5a358`; suite 1,502 twice on the branch, 1,495 on main
with the three padcluster twins arming the flag themselves). §20b
built: stage 1 = the airside pavement problem alone (runway/taxi/apron
from the law, its own polish and projections), stage 2 = everything
with every airside column SUBSTITUTED as a constant (a ±tol box would
mint ~40 k hard rows); (1b) a row with a `follows` or a conformance
head is never stage 1's even when all-airside (a welded pad's skirt
rows between two apron vertices — 9,936 moved with the rule as
written); (1c) a stage triangulates only its own faces (the bending
stencil never leaves the stage). Measured: airside moved vs DISARM
8,976 (OFF) → 10,371 (staged) — NOT the coupling: 405 moved vertices
over a kilometre from any pad; (a) the pad derivation CHANGES THE
AIRSIDE PROBLEM (268 airside vertices gone, 93 new, 844 → 841 apron
faces; the body datum and 2-D trend refit) and (b) the airside solve
is UNSETTLED (stage 1 alone: 42 of 161,690 hard rows, max 0.18 m — 13y
(B)/13ab), so a perturbed problem lands on a different optimum. The
conforming side pays (`pads` 4 → 199, `road_ramp` 15 → 48) because
airside cannot yield a centimetre — which §20b forbids. Stage clocks
90.3 + 5.5 = 95.8 s vs 117.9 single (0.81×). Terminal 72.60 → 73.05.

* RULING: both ship OFF. The airside becomes invariant under pads
  only when (i) THE PAD DERIVATION LEAVES THE AIRSIDE VERTEX SET ALONE
  — a pad clipped by airside shares the airside's EXISTING vertices
  and adds none; the body datum / 2-D trend are fitted on airside
  alone (the pads never enter the fit) — and (ii) the airside solve
  SETTLES (13y (B)/13ab — the standing first-ranked debt: 42 unsettled
  hard rows at HECA). Then staged ON gives identity by construction.
  Two lanes, in that order, before 1.0.335 arms pads at HECA.
* Deviations recorded for the spec author: §23.3 (the airside sheet
  borrowing the ground's datum across the stencil) is false under §20b
  at the sheet's edge (valley fixture +2.68 → −3.92; HECA inert); a
  welded pad's 1 % ceiling is unreachable under §20b (the two-sided
  row 14al withdrew can return, since under §20b it cannot pull).
* The OTHH customer line is untouched: OTHH on main = 1.0.334's
  surface (both flags off).

## 2026-09-14al v2padcluster round 4 STOPPED (not merged): the terminal is on its pad (72.60, body +0.08), the runway's worst pull 3.14 → 0.41 m, but 14,263 airside vertices still move (worst 4.55) — the skirt is two-sided; ruled: rigid core + one-way skirt band; round 5

Lane `v2padcluster` @ 16da0f22 (HECA `v2padclusterHECA5` ledger
85c18b3071e6; KCLT `v2padclusterKCLT4` ledger dca6d7449633; SPJC
`v2padclusterSPJC4`; suite 1,474 twice). (7): 359,152 m² in 1,518
leaf pads + 175,708 m² walled-under-threshold removed (39 % of the
pad area beside the apron); emitted pad area 1.21 → 1.09 M m². Bars:
terminal SURFACE 72.60 (bar 72.50, DISARM 72.07) — MET; the body
`T3_concrete_white b4` on walled cluster pad `building298` via
`fu:38:96@cluster_pad` (18 members), own ground +0.08; the pad +0.55 m
fill vs the DISARM ground; `T3_38 b1` (building 160) −6.70 → +0.04,
`b3` (147) −2.45 → −0.33, `b4` (170) −0.02 both arms — the other four
of the seven not readable by body index (indices renumber under the
cut). Airside moved 14,263 / 29,783 (worst 4.55; runway 1,021, worst
0.41); `pad_cluster_mismatch` 14; `pad_airside_weld` 16 (worst
1.135); constraints +15.7 % (the pad population, `pad_flats` 10.6 →
2.5 s). (8)'s whole-plate one-way form REFUTED (the plate has no
rigid relation in the first lag round — the §30 twin's pad collapsed
703.56 → 640.89); what shipped is the airside-sharing pair priced at
the pad's slope CEILING (8,967 skirt rows, two-sided) — that alone
took the runway's worst 3.14 → 0.41. Twins re-founded and named; the
weld family re-read at "within the pad's own slope cap". KCLT: the
terminal pad 221.46 → 220.93 IS the weld (743 nodes shared with
`pav14`, step 0 by construction, spread = the apron's fall) — the
owner's KCLT read is the acceptance. SPJC with heights: the viaduct
`xp11_007__b0` on pad `building7` at 20.07 in a 6-member unit (13df:
19.56 in the 24-member unit) — the owner's SPJC read.

* RULING §16g (10) (8) refined — RIGID CORE + ONE-WAY SKIRT: the pad's
  non-airside vertices form a cap-0 rigid core (the plate keeps a
  rigid relation); only the SKIRT BAND — vertices within
  `pad_skirt_m` (25 m) of an airside-sharing edge — follows the
  airside ONE-WAY (airside leads, never pulled) within the pad slope
  ceiling; beyond the band the pad is flat. The two-sided ceiling row
  is withdrawn (it is what still pulls 14,263 airside vertices).
* Round 5: the rigid-core/one-way-skirt form; bars: airside moved 0
  (the runway 0.41 → 0); the terminal stays at its pad; `pad_airside_
  weld` → 0 or named; `pad_cluster_mismatch` 14 attributed; constraints
  ≤ +20 % accepted (the population); KCLT/SPJC re-read on the same
  frames.

## 2026-09-14aj v2padcluster round 3 STOPPED: (4) and (5) hold (T3 resolved, apron untouched on the map) but the solve still moves 17,482 airside vertices — the trilemma named; ruled: leaves get no pad, a pad bends to the airside at its rim; round 4

Lane `v2padcluster` @ a1ae0950 (HECA `v2padclusterHECA4`, ledger
72fb36419b42; KCLT `v2padclusterKCLT3` at 01724ef4; suite 1,475
twice). The T3 chain: two single-component CEILING plates (`T3_4.obj`,
extent 0.00 m) carry 3,594 of 9,333 edges, `floor.obj` 996,
`concrete_3` 219 — floor and ceiling hold the district together;
with (4) the largest cluster 541,200 m² / 9,334 bodies → 171,086 m² /
1 body (clusters 1,954 → 4,278). (5): apron area 2.94 → 3.01 M m² (pads
no longer eat apron). The terminal body +7.66 → **+0.15 m off its own
ground** (it left the 52-member unit). BUT: airside moved > 0.02 m
17,482 of 29,465 (worst 12.15; runway 856, worst 3.14); the terminal
SURFACE 80.94 (bar 72.50; DISARM 72.07); `pad_airside_weld` 16 → 24;
`pad_cluster_mismatch` 27; constraints +55 %; KCLT terminal pad 221.46
→ 220.56 (−0.90, by coordinate — `building{N}` renumbers). Mechanism:
345,016 m² of new hard-flat pad now sits BESIDE the apron along its
whole perimeter and a shared vertex is one unknown (09-01g) — the
conflict moved from the interior to the edge. Stated: a derived pad is
(a) one hard plane, (b) welded to the apron along its rim, (c)
forbidden to move the apron — any two hold, not three. Attempts to
make the rim one-way broke 13 twins that encode the OLD plate law.

* RULING §16g (10) (7) LEAVES GET NO PAD: a derived pad is minted for a
  WALLED cluster only (≥ `chain_min_height_m`, ≥ `cluster_pad_min_m2`);
  a leaf (slab, plate, deck, canopy, road) seats on its own ground and
  never mints a pad — the 171,086 m² single-body "cluster" and most of
  the 345,016 m² beside the apron are leaves.
* RULING §16g (10) (8) — drop (a) AT THE RIM: a pad is FLAT (cap 0)
  across its interior and its non-airside rim; along an airside-sharing
  edge its rim vertices are ONE-WAY FOLLOWERS of the airside (airside
  leads, never moves), and the plate meets those pinned vertices within
  the pad's slope ceiling (1 %) — a bent skirt, not a step. The twins
  that assert a two-sided cap-0 plate at an airside edge encode the old
  law and are RE-FOUNDED, not preserved. (14ai's `pad_airside_weld`
  fires only where even the ceiling cannot reach.)
* KCLT −0.90 m at the terminal pad is a LAWFUL change under (6)/(8) if
  it is the weld to the apron — the lane names the airside face and
  the step before/after; the owner's KCLT read is the acceptance.
* Round 4: (7) + (8); bars: HECA airside moved 0; the terminal body
  on a WALLED cluster's pad within 0.02, the pad within 1 % of the
  airside it touches, the pad's cut/fill vs the DISARM ground named
  (80.94 vs 72.07 explained or gone); `pad_cluster_mismatch` 0;
  `pad_airside_weld` 0; constraints ≤ +10 %; KCLT build at the final
  tree; SPJC build carrying heights (dry is inert).

## 2026-09-14ah v2padcluster round 1–2 STOPPED, NOT merged: derived pads as hard flat regions moved 13,637 airside vertices and made the terminal WORSE; the T3 district stays ONE 9,334-body cluster — the chain runs through SLABS; §16g (10) (4) written; round 3

Lane `v2padcluster` @ 6fdcb593 (HECA matched pair, law-value disarm:
`v2padclusterHECAdisarm` vs `v2padclusterHECA2`, ledger beb3e32ab119).
`geom/cluster_outline.py` (one outline derivation shared by classify
and constraints), `pad_from_cluster`, `floor_split_m`,
`pad_cluster_mismatch` family, `obj8_split_report --rows-near`.
Numbers: `pad_cluster_mismatch` 369 (r1) → 44 (41 clusters in > 1
piece, 3 pads spanning clusters); clusters on exactly one pad 206 →
322 of 1,400; building pad area 867 k → 1,370 k m² (652 faces);
**airside vertices moved > 0.02 m: 13,637 of 21,534, worst 10.14 m;
the runway itself 1,110 of 3,426, worst 4.38 m**; the terminal at
30.1279552, 31.403143 72.07 → 82.90 (+10.83; `T3_49.obj b4` 7.66 m
above its feet); constraints +57 %. Mechanism: 502,561 m² of new hard
flat pad (94,795 m² from apron, ~370,000 m² from faceless ground)
welded to the apron by 09-01g — the solve, not the map. Refuted by
measurement: (i) the T3 district does NOT resolve by floor level — its
footed bodies stand at 0.00 and −1.00 and genuinely touch → ONE
cluster of 9,334 bodies / 541,200 m²; (ii) reading the floor per
component splits tall buildings per storey (2,677 → 20,203). KCLT
control unchanged BY CONSTRUCTION (its plan carries no outlines).

* RULING §16g (10) (4) — WHAT CHAINS: a cluster chains only through
  bodies that have WALLS. A thin body — a floor slab, plate, deck,
  canopy, road, apron object, anything whose solid height is under
  `chain_min_height_m` (2.5 m) or that the object stage already
  classes as a deck/plate/pavement — is a LEAF: it is seated (on its
  own ground or its carrier) but is never a link between two walled
  bodies. HECA's T3 district chains through its authored ground
  slabs (`floor_more_yellow`, `T3_concrete_Yellow`, the 1,144 m
  "body" of 13cs); with slabs as leaves the district resolves into
  its buildings.
* RULING §16g (10) (5) — A DERIVED PAD NEVER TAKES AIRSIDE GROUND: the
  pad polygon is the cluster's outline CLIPPED by every airside face
  (runway family, taxi family, apron): airside is king, §30 (4)'s own
  clause. A cluster whose outline lies wholly on airside pavement gets
  no pad (its bodies seat on the pavement).
* Round 3 (RESUME): (4) and (5) at the derivation; bars: HECA airside
  vertices moved 0; the terminal at 72.50; `pad_cluster_mismatch`
  → 0 (a cluster in > 1 piece splits at its outline's connected
  components — the named lever, now ARMED); the seven buildings by
  coordinate (14g's table: 138 ≈ `building_texture_4 b7`, etc. — the
  lane reads `site.py`); constraints ≤ +10 %; KCLT: a BUILD carrying
  outlines is owed (dry is inert); SPJC 19.56 dry.

## Tool: obj8_split_report

| `Ortho4XP/tools/obj8_split_report.py` | THE OBJ8 SPLIT, DRY-RUN (spec `object-placement-spec.md` §4 / §6 / §7; owner RULINGS 2026-09-11b) — what a pack's object stage becomes once placements are AGL, objects are cut into their RIGID BODIES and each body carries its own anchor. Reads only a build's own two products — the re-seat plan (`<ICAO>.rebake.json`: the pack read once, its welded parts and the ε-contact graph) and the emitted DESIGN SURFACE (`<ICAO>.graded.json`, whose `building` faces are the object pads and `structure_rim` breaklines the basin walls) — and NEVER opens the pack for writing, never reads the DSF and never builds anything. Prints per placement the bodies, their §6 class, each body's anchor point / reason / authored offset, the files that would be written and the placements KEPT WHOLE with the reason (`one_body`, `anim`, `unparsable`); `--write-into DIR` writes every cut file into a scratch dir and parses each back through `airport/obj8.parse_obj8` (LEMD 13,924 files, OTHH 65,360, all parsing back with the written triangle count, 2026-09-11); and prints §7's CENSUS — the design surface at a body's ANCHOR against the surface under each of its ground-contact FEET, the |Δ| histogram `seat_feet_census.py` prints from a mesh and a seat result, read instead from the plan and the design surface so the two are comparable. A foot or anchor outside every graded face reads `off-surface` and is never guessed at (the DEM governs there and this tool does not open the DEM). `--no-cut` for body counts only, `--filter`, `--json`, `--split-tol` to override `[placement] split_tol_m`. ROUND 2 (owner RULINGS 2026-09-11e, spec §9): the bodies are COARSENED (bodies of one placement whose intended-zero terrain heights agree within `split_tol_m` are one file, the senior body's anchor; an elevated body joins the nearest ground group) and each anchor is the GENERIC one (the footprint point where the design surface equals the body's zero; a body with authored relief beyond its skirt takes its low-side foot and is reported with the residual) — LEMD 302 placements -> 985 files (3.26x), OTHH 954 -> 1,172 (1.23x). §13 (owner RULINGS 2026-09-11r/s): an ELEVATED body — one whose lowest authored vertex, or the `y_zero` of the anchor the generic rule gives it, stands above `[rebake] elevated_base_m` — NEVER has a file of its own; it joins its CARRIER (the same placement's ground body with the largest plan overlap, else the nearest) at its authored offset, and a placement with NO ground body is KEPT WHOLE with reason `footless`. The report prints the two classes by name — `elevated bodies as own files` (BAR 0) and `footless placements kept whole` — because the FEET histogram cannot see this defect: the writer shifts an elevated body so its own lowest vertex lands on the terrain and every foot then reads perfect (LEMD's 218 roofs/decks/tower parts censused green while the sim was broken). Measured on matched pack copies: LEMD own-files 278 -> 0, files 1,099 -> 828, feet > 3 m 1,060 -> 151, worst 34.06 -> 13.75 m; OTHH 1,203 -> 333 files, feet > 3 m 952 -> 6. ROUND 3 (owner RULINGS 2026-09-11f, spec §10): the write half RESTORES every `<obj>.anchor_bak` in the pack before any file is written (counts in the plan's provenance), and a LINE OBJECT authored as one component is cut into SEGMENTS by triangle station (`--line-segment M` overrides `[placement] line_segment_m`; 0 disarms it) — LEMD 897 segments from 271 one-line bodies, 985 -> 1,086 files, census `> 3 m` 30 -> 25; OTHH 1,187 files, `> 3 m` 0. `--write-pack PACK_COPY` runs THE WHOLE WRITE HALF into a pack COPY through `airport/placement_write.apply_plan` (cut files, DSF + backup + provenance, dump-cache refresh, `o4_v2_placement_<ICAO>.json`) and reads the written DSF back; it REFUSES a live X-Plane install. The census also splits the feet over 0.3 m into BURIED (lawful) and FLOATING (the defect the eye reads). `--rows-near LAT,LON[,R]` (lane `v2padcluster`, 2026-09-14) is that SAME projection selected BY PLACE — every body whose ANCHOR is within R metres (default 40) of the coordinate, nearest first, each row carrying its `site_m` — because the owner names a defect by coordinate and the shapeIDs in a report go stale between builds while a coordinate does not; `osm_site --at/--contains` answers the other half of a site question (which emitted FACES cover the point) and is not re-spelled here. Promoted from the scout `v2heca331`'s scratchpad `site.py` on its SECOND use (RULINGS `7e90032`, promote-on-reuse): the 14g attribution, then §16g (10)'s per-site bars; its graded-face half was already `osm_site`'s and was NOT copied. Twin: `tests/auto_patch_v2/test_v2objsplit.py::test_rows_near_selects_the_same_rows_BY_PLACE`. `--rows SUBSTR,SUBSTR` (lane `v2canopy4`) prints the PER-BODY rows of the placements named — the body's anchor (point, surface z, `y_zero`, reason), its ground-contact feet, its worst foot signed with |Δ|, and the 0.3 m verdict — for the owner's named sites (`OldTerminal_FSX-LEMD38,-LEMD84,-LEMD60`); it is a PROJECTION of the one census pass, never a second instrument (the bins, feet and worst list are identical with and without it, twinned). §14 (owner RULINGS 2026-09-11u/v, lane `v2carrier`): a FOOTLESS placement is CARRIED — written as a body file at its CARRIER's anchor with the carrier's `y_zero` (the footed body of its UNIT it abuts with the largest contact, else the nearest, else the largest) — a BASIN resource is never split and anchors at a RIM point where the design surface equals its zero (`rims` wired at last), and bodies of one resource that OVERLAP IN PLAN bind whatever the contact graph says. The report prints the four §14 bars (`footless at datum` 0, `footless on ground` 0, `basin bodies split` 0, `spread`) beside §13's, from `airport/placement_carrier.census_v14` — the same call `seat_feet_census --placement-plan` makes over the same plan shape, so the two instruments are one code path. Measured on the app's 1.0.315 LEMD frame: the four footbridge resources at the terminal's zero 616.65 (deck bottom road + 4.4-5.0 m, was ON the road), `Terminal4SAT_pink-LEMD01` at its terminal's 597.43, the basin's three resources one file each on ONE rim vertex (zero spread 7.0 m -> 0.00, parapet +2.99 above the rim), files 828 -> 855, round trip OK, row census `> 3 m` 17. Twin: `tests/auto_patch_v2/test_v2objsplit.py`. §15 (owner RULINGS 2026-09-11ae, lane `v2roofcarrier`): the CARRIER IS WHAT THE BODY STANDS OVER — chosen across the whole UNIT, every resource alike, by largest PLAN OVERLAP beneath, else largest contact, else nearest (§13's same-placement scope and §14's contact-first order are superseded; the pack names its roofs as their own resources, so the walls a roof rides are almost never its own file); the plan-overlap BOND is RE-CUT where a bound group's intended zeros span more than `split_tol_m` (a rigid body is never wider than the terrain it can stand on; BASIN exempt); DUPLICATE ROWS of one resource identical in lon/lat/heading are ONE placement, all of them replaced (`--write-pack` reports `duplicate rows of a SPLIT placement ... surviving after the write`, bar 0); an anchor or foot on no graded face is marked OFF-SHEET and excluded from every comparison and bar; and the report prints §15 (3)'s `stands-over float > 0.5 m` from `airport/placement_carrier.census_v15` — `float = zero - zero_beneath`, the class NEITHER the feet histogram nor §14's bars can see (a carried body has no feet at all), barred at 0 for CARRIED bodies and reported for footed ones. §16 (owner RULINGS 2026-09-11ai, lane `v2skipped`): the report adds the POPULATION census (`placement_carrier.census_population`: `rows on the datum outside the plan` — the resources the SEAT-era thickness gate dropped, which keep the pack's shared-datum row and render where the datum is, bar 0 — beside the lawful skips and the multi-anchor class, reported not barred) and `census_v16`'s `float = zero - ground_under_geometry`: the ground read under the body's OWN parts (`geom_box` / `foot_boxes`, the median of the part-box centres) and never under its carrier's box — `CARRIED bodies whose carrier's zero is over 1 m from the ground under their own geometry` (bar 0; LEMD 39 -> 0 on matched arms) and `files whose own-geometry ground departs over 3 m from the ground at their row` (26, reported). `--admit-skipped PACK_ROOT` puts the thickness-gated resources of a PRE-§16 plan back into the population by reading their rows from the pack's own DSF (one part per component, no contact graph, the member id IS the DSF row index) — what a build's own plan now carries, for replaying a plan written before the switch; LEMD 25 resources / 25 rows, OTHH 99. §16a (owner RULINGS 2026-09-11aj, lane `v2skipped2`): a CARRIED body is cut where its CARRIER is cut (one piece per carrier terrain group its own triangles stand over, each riding that group's zero; never by the ground under itself), the ground check moved to the carrier's OWN feet (`Candidate.ground_off`, `surface(foot) - y_foot` against the body's zero), and `census_v16`'s carried number demoted to INFORMATION — the bar for a carried body is §15 (3)'s `zero - zero_beneath`. The report prints `carried bodies left uncut by the ground` / `cut by their CARRIER into N piece(s)` and, beside the §15 bar, how many of the carried floats stand over a body the law REFUSES as a carrier. LEMD carried float 58 → 4, files 1,591 → 1,328, plan stage 9.9 → 6.3 s; OTHH 7 → 39, 46.4 → 60.2 s (both OTHH bars missed and reported). 11ak (lane `v2skipped3`): the CARRIED bar's `beneath` is the carrier THE LAW CHOSE (`merged_into`, resolved by identity over every row that reads a zero — a carrier written WHOLE names its MEMBER RESOURCE, which is the whole of OTHH's residual), and a body the law REFUSES as a carrier is counted and named as its own class, `carried over a refused body`, with how far its own feet stand off; §16 (2) also cuts BY FOOT (`placement_cut._LineCutter.foot_groups`: the feet grouped by the zero each says the body has, `surface(foot) - y_foot`, each triangle joining the group of the foot nearest it in plan) — the class no ground cut can see, a body whose FEET are authored over metres of relief on terrain that barely moves, which is exactly what §16a (2) refuses. The re-cut line prints the three cuts (terrain / triangle / foot). LEMD carried float 4 → 0, refused carriers 117 → 21 (13 of the residue are rim-anchored BASIN bodies the foot cut is exempt from), files 1,328 → 1,371, plan stage 6.2 → 5.66 s; OTHH carried 42 → 0, refused 55 → 19, files 1,679 → 1,622, plan stage 59 → 31 s (`solid_components` read in one sort instead of a mask per component; `bind_plan_overlaps` swept by the hull's south edge). 11al (lane `v2basincarry`): a BASIN body is EXEMPT from §16a (2)'s ground test — its zero is the RIM (§14 (2)) and its floor feet are authored below it by construction — so it may carry, and the report prints `§16a (2) basin carriers` (how many basins, how many the feet test would have refused) beside the refusal set: LEMD refused carriers 21 → 8, OTHH 19 → 4, carried float 0/0 unchanged. §14a (owner RULINGS 2026-09-11ap item 6, lane `v2basinring`): a BASIN body follows its RING. §24 (1) puts the rim vertices at the APRON's level, so the ring is not level (LEMD's T4 pit 597.68 … 599.52 over 59 nodes) while §14 (2) wrote every basin body at ONE rim point — the owner's "gap between wall and apron", +0.71 / −1.13 m, while the §14 `spread` bar read 0.01 because it measures the pit's bodies against EACH OTHER. `airport/basin_ring.py` (NEW: the whole law — `arcs_of`, `ring_arcs`, `member_kind`, `ring_bar`) cuts the ring into ARCS whose z agrees within `split_tol_m` and cuts each basin body's WALL BAND by them, one piece per arc anchored at that arc's rim point (the interior remainder keeps §14 (2)'s single point: the trench floor is one level); and a member authored AT THE RIM PLANE but standing inside the ring is a FLOOR body that takes §16 (3)'s ground under its own footprint, never the rim, never a carrier. The report prints the RE-DEFINED bar — `§14a spread of a BASIN RING = max |wall base − ring z| over its nodes` (bar ≤ `split_tol_m`), with the nodes on an arc the pit has NO WALL on reported beside it — and the `§14a basin FLOOR members` / `basin bodies cut by the ring's ARCS` counts. It needs the rings WITH their heights (`census_v14(rims=..., arc_cap=..., counts=...)`; `RimRing.z`, and the `basin_arc_wall:<ref>#<k>` counts keys the cut writes are how the bar tells "no wall here" from "the wall is written in the interior piece"). Matched arms on the app's 1.0.319 LEMD frame: the ring bar 1.12 m / 9 nodes over → **0.18 m / 0 over**, `LEMD13__b0` off the rim and onto its own ground, files 1,371 → 1,394, feet > 3 m 518 → 412, floating 9,509 → 9,014; OTHH's 21 basin carriers and its whole foot census byte-identical. §16b (owner RULINGS 2026-09-11ap, lane `v2owncut`): the TERRAIN CUT IS PRIOR AND UNIVERSAL and is read on the body's OWN WRITTEN TRIANGLES — including everything the writer will put in the file (`placement_cut._LineCutter.all_tris`: a placement the plan reads as ONE body is written as the WHOLE object, which is why `green-TEJ3`'s 4-triangle part read 0.22 m of ground while its 2,342 m file stood +16.22 m over it) — so a CARRIED body is divided by the ground under itself first and §16a (1)'s carrier cut runs inside each piece; §9's coarsening additionally requires PLAN CONTIGUITY (`[placement] coarsen_reach_m`, 30 m) and acts WITHIN a terrain group (the pieces carry the ground they stand on, or the very next pass welds them back); each PIECE finds its own carrier, and a FALLBACK candidate (contact / nearest / largest, no plan overlap) is refused unless its zero is within `split_tol_m` of the ground under the piece (`carrier_refused_far_from_carried_ground`). The report prints `census_v16b`'s two bars over the WRITTEN geometry the plan now publishes per body (`geom_pts`, one sample per 10 m cell, thinned to 32 by the farthest-point walk): `carried piece float over its own ground > 0.5 m` and `body wider than its terrain group`, both bar 0, with the BASIN exemptions (§14 (2) / 11al) counted apart and the wide residue split by class. `--coarsen-reach M` overrides the contiguity reach. Measured on the app's 1.0.319 LEMD frame: the owner's item 3 +10.74 → the plate ON the roof beneath it (618.58 vs the group's 618.60), item 5 +16.22 → 620.38 vs 620.27, `Terminal4_48` zero-vs-ground −4.02 → median −0.01, `Taxisigns-SENRG` 38 of 80 bodies over 0.3 m → 12 of 419; files 1,371 → 3,272 at the amended 100 m reach (4,633 at the refuted 30 m), plan stage 5.6 → 10.1 s (bar ≤ 8 s MISSED, reported). §16c (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12b/12d, lane `v2atom`): THE CONNECTED COMPONENT IS THE ATOM — `--torn-seams PACK_ROOT` prints the TORN-SEAM CENSUS over a WRITTEN pack (the plan argument is then the WRITTEN `o4_v2_placement_<ICAO>.json` and `--graded` is not read), and the same census prints automatically after `--write-pack`: sibling files of ONE placement that share an AUTHORED VERTEX (the key `obj8.solid_components` welds on, `round(x, 3)`) are two halves of one connected solid written at two zeros, with the base step per seam, the step histogram, the worst list and the per-class breakdown, and §10's line segments / §14a's basin arcs — the only lawful station cuts — counted APART.  Two bars, both 0: `torn seams outside line/arc pieces` and `single-component resources in >= 2 files`.  The instrument is the scout `v2lemd320`'s `tear.py`, promoted on its second use, and lives in `airport/placement_seams.py` (`census_torn_seams` / `census_torn_seams_lines`, re-exported through `placement_census`).  Measured on the live 1.0.320 LEMD pack it reproduces the owner's four sites exactly (`HANG3` 10 files / 14 seams worst 3.05 m; `green-LEMD50` 7 / 11.12 m; `Bridge2` 8 / 11.72 m; `green-STRT4` 53 files, `__b44` 16.29 m) and the class (2,554 seams, 1,994 over 0.30 m).  On matched replay arms the law takes LEMD 723 -> **0** seams and 128 -> **0** single-component splits (files 3,253 -> 2,804, plan stage 13.5 -> 10.2 s over 3 runs, round trip OK), OTHH 639 -> **1** and 165 -> **1** (files 1,897 -> 1,898). §16c (6) (RULINGS 2026-09-12h, round 2): `--contact-eps M` overrides `[placement] contact_eps_m` (2 mm) — components of ONE resource whose geometry comes within it, or whose parts the rebake plan's ε-contact graph already links, BIND into one rigid body for anchoring (one zero, the senior component's carrier): OTHH's `OTHH_Fuel_02_LOD0_007` carries two components 0.4 mm apart that the millimetre weld key reads as separate.  LEMD files 2,804 -> 2,776, seams stay 0, `Terminal4_48` zero spread 3.58 -> 0.69 m, plan stage 9.6 s (main 13.5). ROUND 3 (RULINGS 2026-09-12j): the entry now runs inside `harness/shared_repo_guard`'s WRITE GUARD and its before/after audit (a round-2 OTHH `--admit-skipped` run had created `Airport_mod_cache/Global Airports/+25+051.dsf.e0518fe0.text` in the SHARED repo with both lane-local cache env vars exported and nothing refused it); every run prints `[guard] shared repo UNCHANGED`.  `--rigid-reach M` overrides `[placement] rigid_reach_m` (2.0) — §16c (8): SOLID components of one resource within it chain into ONE rigid cluster, which is the atom of the BODY as well as of the cut (LINE objects excluded).  `carrier_fill_min` is DELETED from carrier candidacy (§16c (7)); the CLASS exclusion stays.  LEMD: `HANG3` 6 files / 1.37 m -> 2 / 0.45, `green-STRT4` 23 -> 15 files (spread 8.90 -> 3.73), files 2,776 -> 2,121, §16b wide 1,405 -> 967, seams 0, round trip OK; five largest rigid clusters are all SINGLE components (5,157 / 2,890 / 2,514 m — fences and VOR markers, not chained) and `green-TEJ3` stays 9 components / 9 clusters. §17 THE COCKPIT BLOCK (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12x/12y, lane `v2cockpit`) is printed FIRST, before the §14 bars: the §15 floats, the §16a (2) refusal set's `ground_off`, the §16b own-ground floats and the §16c torn seams classified CRITICAL VISUAL at `[cockpit] visual_m` 0.5 m (with the worst named by resource AND coordinate) or REPORT under it, from `placement_census.cockpit_block` — the SAME `[cockpit]` law keys the terrain census reads, one frame for both stages. `split_tol_m` 0.3 stays a PARTITION choice and its `body wider than its terrain group` count is REPORT whatever its size. **§17 CRITICAL MOTION IS READ** (owner RULINGS 2026-09-12am (2), lane `v2objmotion`): the graded surface's FACE ROLE under every foot (`airport/placement_boxes.GradedRoles` / `graded_roles_from_doc`, built from the SAME parsed `<ICAO>.graded.json` the sampler and the pads are, senior face by `precedence.toml`'s authority order, a 55 m grid over the faces' boxes) joined to §7's own float there (`airport/placement_motion.census_motion`, re-exported through `placement_census`): a body with a foot on a ROLLED-ON face (`law.tables.rolled_on_roles`) is ON PAVEMENT and every such foot is judged at `[cockpit] motion_step_m` 0.05 m, named with resource, foot coordinate, face role and SIGN. The block prints the count of bodies on pavement, the feet over the threshold, the worst ten, and the breakdowns by resource / face role / body class / anchor rule / size band, plus what the EYE reads at those feet (floating vs buried over `visual_m`) and the MEDIAN-anchor arm. BASIN bodies are counted APART (§14 (2) / 11al: a pit's zero is its rim and its floor feet are authored below it — they were LEMD's whole worst ten). Measured on the 1.0.320 LEMD frame: 493 of 2,153 bodies stand on pavement, 7,124 feet on 399 over 0.05 m; after the §17 anchor rule 6,635 on 407 (OTHH 6,234 → 3,877 on 113 → 103). RULINGS 2026-09-12ap (lane `v2pavefeet`): `--motion-rows OUT.json` writes §17's PER-BODY projection — one row per written body with its anchor, class, anchor reason and every ground-contact foot (lat/lon, authored y, surface z, face role, on-pavement, float) — the rows `census_motion` itself reads, never a second census (the scout's scratchpad projection, promoted on its second use). (E) THE SAMPLER HONOURS GRADED HOLES: a Delaunay over the emitted VERTICES spans a hole ring with triangles reaching from an apron vertex to a trench vertex, and LEMD read **592.22 m at a point whose ROLE is apron** six metres outside the hole — 12ap's two worst pavement feet (`LEMDblast__b1` +7.18, `Terminal4sBlue-STRT4__b1` −5.08) were that fabricated ramp, and the anchor correction is 6.91 m. A simplex CROSSING a hole ring with a step over `split_tol_m` is struck and a point inside one reads the nearest vertex of that simplex ON ITS OWN SIDE of the ring; measured narrowings: "centroid on no face" struck 8,689 of 47,287 simplices and cost 421 files / 435 off-sheet bodies, and a strike with no side-aware read cost 160. (B) §17 is judged at the GROUND-CONTACT feet — the in-band feet within `split_tol_m` of the lowest (`placement_motion.ground_contact_feet`); `contact_band_m` is shared law and unchanged, BOTH sets are sampled and the wider reading prints beside the judged one so the report states its own attribution. (A) `bind_ground_m` (`[cockpit] visual_m`) bounds §16c (7): a FOOTED body of ANOTHER member keeps the cluster only while its own zero is within it of the senior's, else it keeps its own anchor and is counted — the report prints `bound refused for ground N` with the worst refused disagreement and the widest RETAINED cluster zero-plane span. Matched arms, LEMD main → branch: CRITICAL MOTION 6,640 → 5,400 feet on 407 → 356 bodies, over 0.5 m FLOATING 663 → 128 and BURIED 1,109 → 808 (of which (B) alone 581 → 128 / 816 → 808), worst pavement foot +7.18 → +2.41 m, 74 binds refused (worst 2.38 m), files 2,107 → 2,149, seams 0/0, round trip OK, plan stage 10.19 → 10.03 s; OTHH 3,891 → 2,822 feet on 103 → 74, floating 332 → 12, §14 footless at datum 5 → 4, files 1,252 → 1,269, plan stage 60.8 → 61.4 s (the ≤ 60 s bar missed on BOTH arms). §16b's carried-piece float and wide counts move the WRONG way at both airports (LEMD 111 → 119 / 967 → 983, OTHH 126 → 135 / 75 → 78) and are named. §16d (owner RULINGS 2026-09-13h, lane `v2unboxed`): THE PLAN BOXES WHAT THE WRITER WRITES — a WRITTEN-FRAME bar beside the torn seams, `§16d bodies with written geometry > 1 m outside their geom_box` (`airport/placement_seams.census_outside_box`, printed after `--write-pack` and by `--torn-seams`, bar 0): `geom_box` was the hull of the ADMITTED PARTS while the writer emitted the source object's triangles regardless, so a component no part named (the FS2XPlane origin plate, an exporter's ground paint, a roof plate over the next hangar) rode a zero the body chose elsewhere and NO instrument read it — LEMD 1.0.325 live pack 378 of 2,109 bodies, 8 over a kilometre. Every connected component the writer will emit — draped ones included — is now PLACED: within `coarsen_reach_m` of a ground group's part hull it joins that group and `geom_box` grows to the hull of what the file will contain; beyond it, it is a FOOTLESS BODY §15's search places, or §16 (3)'s own ground (`--coarsen-reach 0` disarms the reach and the component joins the nearest body, the pre-§16d reading). The nearest-footed fallback is CAPPED at the same reach (`carrier_refused_nearest_beyond_reach`), and the COCKPIT block names the worst row by the centre of the BODY'S OWN written geometry, never the placement row (a shared-datum pack puts 96.5 % of its bodies on two points). `plan stage: N.NN s` is printed after the split — the number a round's budget is quoted in, timed exactly where the shipped engine's own `build_splits` call is, without the graded parse or the census. Matched dry arms on the 1.0.325 LEMD frame (the app's own arm reads a MESH sampler where the tool reads a Delaunay over the graded vertices — the two disagree on every surface-driven refusal and the bars are read dry-to-dry): outside-box 390 → **0**, nearest-footed over 100 m 29 → **0**, the four shadow plates +15.94/+15.73/+5.77/+1.72 → **−5.00 on their own ground**, `Cargo-TEJ1` on `NEWCO__b9` roof base 604.95 (bar 0.3 of 605.04), seams 0/0, §15 carried float 0/0, round trip OK, files 2,141 → 2,279, LEMD plan stage 13.6 → 17.8 s and OTHH ≈83 → 86.1 s (both bars missed on BOTH arms, named). It also fixed a latent WRITER defect: the cut file was named by its index in the LIVE body list while the DSF row is written on the plan's `body_id` name, so a body the cut left with no triangle shifted every later body's file one name down (`OldTerminal_FSX-DCNEUN`'s `__b0` row held `b1`'s object). §16d (4)-(6) (owner RULINGS 2026-09-13m, same lane, second frame KCLT 1.0.324): a CARRIED body's components group BY CARRIER — each ATOM (§16c (1)'s, so a rigid cluster is never divided) asks its own carrier question BEFORE the search, counted as `carried bodies cut by ATOM`, where §16a (1)'s after-the-fact cut could only divide the answer the whole body got (KCLT 5,295 carried bodies left uncut against 3 cut; a native pack's master roof model spans 1,774 m); §16c (7)'s 0.5 m ground bound is MEMBER-AGNOSTIC (12ap tested `member != top.member`, and a native pack's one-model-per-material member spans the airport: KCLT's `005_ALB__b9` sank 5.04 m into its pad on a same-member bind to an apron body 500 m away); and a FOOTED body whose ground contacts lie mostly inside one emitted `building` pad reads only the contacts ON it (`anchor_rule.pad_majority`; the anchor reason then says `on pad <ref>`). Matched dry arms at KCLT: `005_ALB__b9` -5.85 -> **+0.02** against its pad, widest retained cluster zero span 5.69 -> **0.64 m**, 473 carried bodies divided by atom, 61 bodies anchored on their pad, `building80`'s on-pad zero spread 1.03 m (the pad's own relief 1.19), §16d outside-box **0**, §15 carried float **0**, round trip OK 477/477, one new torn seam (+0.16 m, one shared vertex, named), files 473 -> 477, plan stage 8.65 -> 8.3-8.5 s. It also exposed a defect the atom cut made visible: a target group holding BOTH a cut piece and an untouched raw was read for its `tris` alone, leaving 990-3,280 triangles per placement claimed by no body (9 of KCLT's 103) for `obj8_split` to hand to the nearest one — the audit reads 0 of 103 after. **COST: plan stage LEMD 17.8 -> 25-46 s and OTHH 86 -> 136 s** (KCLT flat) — the per-atom carrier search, narrowed by a `coarsen_reach_m` span gate, a 64-atom cap, per-atom pids and a set-intersection contact count, and still needing the owner's approval and a Fable-5 review before it ships. |

| `Ortho4XP/tools/v2_solve_replay.py` | --why-vertex V [--why-relax FAMILY ...]`; `--why-hard [N]` on either a `--replay` arm or a `--why-from PKL`) | You are iterating on the v2 SOLVE (a law table, a generator, the shape stage, the planar build) and want the runway bows / z − DEM / joints / yielded-rows figures per change WITHOUT paying for the load stage each time — the synthetic-first solve arm (CLAUDE.md BUILD ECONOMY; `docs/specs/auto-patch-v2/heca-sag-ablation/ablate_heca_pin.py` was the scratch pattern, promoted on its second use by lane v2chord, RULINGS 2026-09-08d). `--capture` runs load → **the PACK PARTITION + GROUPS** (`build.py:288-318`, owner RULINGS 2026-09-11j — folded in 2026-09-12u by lane `v2padceiling` after scout `v2unsettled` measured the trap: a capture without them carries an `Airport` with no `partition` and no `groups`, so the replay silently solves a DIFFERENT problem — no `foot_rows`, no `pad_relief` targets, no basin bodies, and the shipped LEMD hard set could not be reproduced at all; a capture predating it is now REFUSED BY NAME at replay, `capture_has_groups`) → classify → planar (which labels the SHAPES, owner RULINGS 2026-09-08k) → flat site → road profile → shape stage exactly as `pipeline/build.py` and pickles the airport, the classification, the planar map and the stage (HECA 56 s; LEMD 232 s, of which 104 s partition); `--replay` resumes from the named stage under the CURRENT tree (constraints + joint filter + yield transform + ONE solve by default — 08k (4), no joint re-solve; `shapes` rebuilds the shapes over the captured map and re-runs the stage — for a change in `planar/shapes.py` or `[terrace]`; `planar` the whole map), and prints per two-threshold runway the crown-ridge BOW, the ridge minimum, z − DEM mean/min/max, the law-tier line, `yielded_rows` per family and the max apron grade PER SHAPE with the steepest rows per family (face, grade, span, lat/lon), the shapes (count, the largest by vertices), the joints (count, gap joints, max built step, the worst with their shape pair), the road steps, and per `--site` the vertices within `--site-radius` (z − DEM, roles, shape ids, the max |dz| over a short edge = a step). `--emit DIR` writes the arm's patch through the build's own emit half so `patch_proximity_diff.py` and `undulation.py` can read a same-frame divergence on a replay arm; `--verify` runs the v2 VERIFY CENSUS on the solved surface and prints the rows per family and the DEFECT families the app's driver gates on (lane v2smooth round 2, RULINGS 2026-09-08v — a weight sweep needs the defect count per arm without a 130 s build); `--design-weight TERM=W` overrides one `emit.toml [design]` weight for the arm (the measurement arm, never a default). `--drop-generator` also accepts the pseudo-generator **`eat_ramp_reach`** (lane `v2eatramp`, spec §36 (5)): the EAT ramp's trend WITHDRAWAL is a channel edit made before the solve, not a row, so it cannot be dropped by the row filter — `eat_anchor_rect` drops the pins and their reach together, `eat_ramp_reach` the withdrawal alone (the §36 (5) before-arm). Lane v2shapes (2026-09-08): HECA capture 56 s; one pass 144–150 s (the 08g three-pass law read 357 s). `--why-from PKL --why-hump RUNWAY S0 S1` (the `solve.why` bindings and chain trace on the highest ridge vertex above the chord, from a duals solve of the SAME LP — kept out of the timed arm) with `--why-relax FAMILY ...` (relax-one-family arms: the hump's dz after a full re-solve without the family — the INTERVENTIONAL holder read). `--why-hard [N]` lists EVERY VIOLATED HARD ROW of the solved surface — generator, ruling, demanded vs allowed metres, and per vertex the id, coefficient, z, DEM, lat/lon and roles — re-assembling the design problem with `solve.design.assemble` and applying design.py's own `2 / Σ|c|` row scaling, so every violation reads in the METRES `hard_tol_m` is stated in (promoted from scout `v2unsettled2`'s `hardrows.py` on its second use, spec §32 (4), RULINGS 2026-09-13ac: `HARD SET NOT SETTLED` names ONE truncated ruling, which cost 12u a scout re-deriving the population by hand and 13ac needed the row's VERTICES to see that main's worst row was a pair the zone projection had clamped independently). **`--emit` IS THE BUILD'S WHOLE EMIT HALF SINCE 2026-09-13** (lane `v2zonebank`, §37 (3)): it ran `graded_surface` -> `write_patch` and SKIPPED `with_bank` / `with_terrain_edges`, so every `bank_foot` question asked of a replay arm read ZERO feet and looked like the defect under attribution — it now runs `pipeline/build.py:780-795` verbatim and prints the `BankReport` line. **`--bank-from SOLVED.pkl`** replays that emit half alone off a `--solved-out` pickle (KCLT 2.5 s against the 160 s `--replay`), with `--emit DIR` and/or **`--bank-walk`**: §37 (3)'s per-station ADJACENT-GROUND ZONE-2 WALK — per `adjacent_ground:*:zone2` face ring, `|z_ring - DEM(foot)|` at every station, the stations at or over `bank_materiality_m`, whether the foot point stands outside the design coverage, whether it falls in the terrain-edge no-bank region or the water cut, and whether a `bank_foot` stands within that station's OWN 1:3 reach (never the airport-wide `bank_max_width_m`, which calls a foot 200 m away near); then, off `emit/bank.with_bank`'s `station_probe` / `region_probe` attribution hooks, the banked-region station the load-bearing verdict was actually taken on and where an unbanked station stands (inside the banked region? inside a coverage HOLE?). It prices no law and counts no defects — defect counts come from `harness/census.py`. Measured basis (KCLT, base `ce203b29`, `cap/KCLT.pkl`): 233 zone2 rings / 5,647 stations, 542 at or over the 1.65 m materiality, 220 with their foot outside the coverage, **110 with no foot at all** — 110 of them inside the banked region and 109 inside a coverage hole, which is how RULINGS 2026-09-13bu item 5 was attributed to `_foot_piece`'s solid exterior disc; after the fix 8. **A CAPTURE PREDATING A TARGET CHANNEL STILL REPLAYS, AND SAYS SO** (2026-09-13, lane `v2roadcontact`): a `PlanarMap` field added since the pickle was written is simply ABSENT on the unpickled instance, so the first `dataclasses.replace` raised `AttributeError` and a REGISTERED FRAME another lane shares became unreplayable for a channel its own stage never produced; `--replay` now backfills each missing field at the dataclass's OWN default and NAMES it on stdout (the publisher derives the channel in the replay anyway). This is NOT a relaxation of the 12u groups refusal, which stands: that one is a capture solving a DIFFERENT problem, this one is a channel the capture never had. Twins: `tests/auto_patch_v2/test_v2padceiling.py` (the capture calls every pre-solve stage `pipeline/build.build` calls, read off both sources; the refusal predicate) — the rest of the replay is an instrument over `pipeline/build.py`'s own stages, which the pipeline twins cover. |

## Standing discipline (unchanged for every lane; the long form is `.claude/agents/lane.md`)

- Worktree: `tools/harness/lane_worktree.sh up <lane> <base sha>`; branch `claude/<lane>`.
  `git merge main` FIRST if main has moved past the base sha.
- `Ortho4XP/venv/bin/python tools/blast.py <file>` before editing each source
  file; a file past 1,000 lines is a warning to reconsider its architecture (split by
  responsibility when it no longer fits; past 1,500 split before merging — owner 13bz).
- ONE closing build through the harness (v2 is the only engine, RULINGS
  2026-09-13au — there is no `--engine` flag); base arms cut with
  `git archive <sha> src`, never another live checkout.
- NEVER write `/Users/noah/XPTerrainBuilderData` or `/Users/noah/X-Plane 12/Custom Scenery/`;
  no `--refresh-data`; every run prints `[guard] shared repo UNCHANGED`;
  lane-local `O4_DSF_CACHE_DIR` / `O4_AIRPORT_MOD_CACHE_DIR` under your scratchpad.
- Any wait loop is bounded (`timeout N` or `$SECONDS`); prefer foreground.
- Suite from `Ortho4XP/` twice: `venv/bin/python -m pytest -q --no-header -p no:cacheprovider -rfE tests/auto_patch_v2 tests/test_harness.py tests/test_role_edge_census.py`.
- Attempt cap two per rule; a bar that moves backwards twice → delete the code, report the measurement.
- Consumer census (RULINGS 2026-08-30l) in the spec MEASURED block before any consumer is edited.
- Extend tools, never fork; INDEX row + twin for any new option. Do NOT merge into main; do NOT write RULINGS.
- Read law with `tools/docq.py spec '§N'`, `tools/docq.py ruling 13xx`, `tools/docq.py index <name>`;
  find captures with `tools/harness/frames.py list [ICAO]`; register yours when done.
- REPORT: branch + sha; per-bar before → after with the frame named; what you did NOT do;
  intent questions with their measurement; files touched.
