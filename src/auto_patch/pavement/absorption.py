"""Long-edge absorption rule for taxi rects.

THE RECURRING-REGRESSION HOT SPOT.  Every recent session that
modified this rule introduced a regression at one of the test
airports.  The rule below is reproduced VERBATIM from
``feedback_shape_rules.md`` (memory: user 2026-04-30, AUTHORITATIVE).
Do not edit the rule without explicit user confirmation; do not
add per-ref preservation exceptions; do not switch EITHER -> BOTH;
do not bump the 10 % threshold or the 5 m probe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
A taxi rect (primary_parallel / secondary_parallel / stub /
cross_connector) has a long edge "covered" by junction-class
pavement (apron / junction / unrolled apt.dat row-110) when that
pavement extends past the long edge for >= 10 % of the rect's axial
length.  When EITHER long edge is covered to >= 10 %, the COVERED
portion is absorbed into the surrounding apron / junction; the
non-covered portion stays as a (possibly shorter) rect.  Partial
absorption -- never absorb the WHOLE rect when only part is
covered.

Implementation:
* Probe at 5 m axial steps; each step is "adjacent" if EITHER
  outside-long-edge sample is inside ``junction_pav`` (apron
  pavement minus runway minus other rects).
* Probe distance = 5 m beyond the rect's long edge (skips sub-1 m
  polygon-imprecision slivers).
* "Adjacent run" must be >= 10 % of axial steps to absorb.
* Kept fragments < 30 m are dropped (avoid emitting micro-stubs).

DO NOT change the absorption behaviour without explicit user
confirmation.  Specifically:
* Don't switch from EITHER to BOTH -- alongside-apron rects must
  absorb.
* Don't add per-ref preservation exceptions -- they override the
  rule.
* Don't bump the 10 % threshold or 5 m probe without confirmation.

The rule is authoritative even when it produces a result that
looks "wrong" at one airport -- propose the change with the
trade-off explained and wait for the user to decide, rather than
edit and report.

    """Drop ``primary_parallel`` rects whose long edges sit entirely
    inside apt.dat row-110 pavement.

    Per user 2026-04-27 invariant: a junction polygon must NEVER run
    along a sloping rect's long edge — X-Plane's elevation engine
    over-constrains the junction's spline to F's long-edge altitudes
    and produces visible elevation glitches.

    There are two ways the invariant gets violated for a primary
    parallel:

    1. apt.dat pavement bulges past the long edge between the rect's
       short corners.  The residue then runs along the long edge to
       reach the bulge.  ``_clip_residue_at_stub_sloping_edges`` already
       handles this for STUBs by carving the bulge away.
    2. The rect sits FULLY INSIDE a paved area (apron, ramp, big
       terminal area).  apt.dat covers the rect's footprint AND
       everything around it; the residue is the apron, and it
       inevitably traces the rect's long edges as it wraps around
       the rect-shaped hole.

    Case 2 doesn't have a "carve away the bulge" fix — there's no
    bulge, the entire surrounding pavement is legitimate apron.  The
    correct behaviour is to NOT emit the rect at all: let the apron
    junction cover the rect's footprint and slope multi-
    directionally.  The primary-parallel grade rule isn't worth
    enforcing for a taxi lane that's just one of many possible
    paths through a paved apron — the apron's own elevation
    propagation produces a perfectly serviceable surface.

    SPJC's F is the canonical example.  F is a 121×60 m primary
    parallel sitting in the middle of the SE apron; row-110 pavement
    covers F + everything around it.  Dropping F lets the SE apron
    (junction -10132) absorb F's footprint instead of wrapping
    around F's long edges.

    Implementation: a primary-parallel rect is considered embedded
    when AT LEAST ONE of its two long edges is ≥ ``embed_frac``
    inside ``apt_pav_union``, AND the strip just outside that edge
    (``long_edge_buffer_m`` wide) is also covered.  Why "at least
    one" instead of "both": a primary parallel can sit on the edge
    of an apron, with one long edge inside the apron (where the
    junction wraps it — the violation we're fixing) and the other
    long edge along the apron's outer pavement boundary (where
    there's no junction at all, so no wrap to worry about).  SPJC's
    F is exactly this: south long edge fully inside the SE apron
    (100 %), north long edge on the apron's outer boundary (27 %).
    Dropping F is correct in both cases — the apron absorbs the
    embedded side, and the boundary side becomes the apron's new
    edge.  Only when NEITHER long edge is embedded does the rect
    actually carry the pavement (a primary parallel through grass)
    — those we must keep.

    """Clip primary_parallel rects whose long edge has a contiguous
    embedded sub-range at one end of the rect's axis.

    Per user 2026-04-27: when a taxiway is bounded by apron pavement
    along most of one side, that bounded section should be ABSORBED
    INTO THE APRON (covered by it, removed from the taxi rect).
    The rule fires for FULL embedding via
    ``_drop_primary_parallels_embedded_in_pavement``; this helper
    handles PARTIAL embedding where only a sub-range of the rect's
    axis is bounded.  The unbounded portion stays as a (shorter)
    sloping rect; the absorbed portion's footprint reappears in
    the residue → junction polygon → apron extends to cover it.

    Algorithm:
        1. Walk the rect's axis at ``step_m``-metre steps.  At each
           step ``u``, sample the left and right long-edge midpoints
           at axial offset ``u`` and check whether either falls
           inside ``pav_union``.
        2. Mark each step as "embedded" or not.
        3. Find embedded contiguous prefixes / suffixes ≥
           ``min_dropped_m`` long.
        4. If clipping the embedded prefix and/or suffix leaves a
           kept range ≥ ``min_kept_m``, replace the rect with the
           clipped version.

    The clipped rect uses the same axis direction; its corners are
    at the new axial bounds projected to the original perpendicular
    half-width.

    At CYXY, taxiway E (469 m, NW-SE oriented) has its NW half
    bounded by SW apron pavement on its west side.  This helper
    clips E's NW portion (~290 m) and keeps the SE portion
    (~180 m), leaving the apron polygon to cover E's NW footprint.
