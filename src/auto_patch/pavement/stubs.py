"""Runway-end primary-parallel stub emission.

For each runway end, projects nearby parallel taxi centerlines
into a short connector ("stub") that bridges the parallel to the
runway threshold area.  These appear at most airports as the
A1/F1-style turn-off taxiways near each runway end.

    """Emit an extra STUB rect at each primary parallel OSM path
    endpoint that terminates INSIDE the runway polygon.

    A / F / L OSM primary taxis at SPJC extend their polyline
    onto the runway pavement itself (the endpoint vertex sits
    inside the runway polygon).  The target hand-drawn OSM has
    a short wide STUB at that transition — the RAMP where the
    taxi meets the runway short-edge.  Detection:

      1. Merge each primary-parallel ref's OSM ways
         (linemerge + gap-bridge, same as the main extraction).
      2. Check each merged polyline's 2 endpoints.
         If an endpoint is INSIDE the runway polygon (or within
         10 m of it), the taxi terminates on runway pavement.
      3. Walk along the polyline from that endpoint toward the
         interior, until the path vertex distance to runway
         boundary exceeds ``STUB_EXIT_D_M`` (~80 m).  The
         "exit" vertex is where the path leaves the runway-
         apron ramp and enters normal taxi corridor.
      4. Emit a STUB rect CENTERED on the exit vertex along the
         local path direction, length ``STUB_LEN_M`` (~80 m).
         The rect width is the perpendicular pav half-width
         at the exit point × 2 (full pav width — the ramp is
         wider than a normal taxi).

    Returns a list of extra (rect, axis, role, ref) tuples to
    append to the main ``taxi_rects`` list.
