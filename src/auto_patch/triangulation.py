"""Per-vertex altitude assignment for junction polygons.

Junction polygons are residue-pavement shapes (apt.dat row-110
covered area minus rect / terminal / runway shapes) that need
per-vertex altitudes so X-Plane can triangulate them with smooth
multi-directional slopes.  This module owns that work.

For every junction:
  1. Collect HARD anchors (rect corners, runway segments, terminals)
     touching the junction's boundary.
  2. Drop sliver corners + spike vertices that would produce
     near-degenerate triangles.
  3. Assign each ring vertex an altitude: planar fit when anchors
     are co-planar enough, otherwise 2D-Euclidean smoothing
     (``_smooth_polygon_grid``).
  4. Stash the per-vertex altitudes on the BuiltShape's
     ``node_altitudes``.

# Layer 2: free-vertex clamping with neighbour-boundary lookup ─────
#
# After _triangulate_junctions sets every junction's per-vertex
# elevation, walk each junction's boundary and tighten any FREE
# vertex (one whose elevation is NOT pinned to a rect/runway/
# terminal corner or to another junction's shared vertex) so that
# it satisfies grade compliance with every nearby shape boundary
# point — not just the same-polygon anchored vertices considered
# during the first smoothing pass.
#
# Why a separate pass:
#   The first-pass smoothing (_smooth_junction_boundary) only
#   considers anchors WITHIN the same polygon.  Adjacent junction
#   polygons that are 1.5–5 m apart but don't share node IDs
#   (HECA's "adjacent-but-not-shared" pattern) can have their
#   nearby boundary vertices drift to incompatible elevations,
#   producing the visible sunken-area / elevated-plateau cliffs
#   the user reported at SPJC and the 159% within-shape grade
#   violations at HECA.
#
# What this pass does NOT change:
#   * Rect / runway / terminal altitudes — those are derived from
#     the elevation graph and the 1.5 % grade rule along the taxi
#     network; this pass operates only on junction polygons.
#   * Anchored junction vertices (shared with another shape via
#     the OSM nid).  Moving them would break the shared-vertex
#     invariant.
#
# Where it operates:
#   For each junction polygon's free vertex V at coord (x, y) with
#   current elevation e_v, scan every other shape's boundary
#   edges within NEIGHBOUR_CLAMP_RADIUS_M.  Each nearby boundary
#   point E at distance d contributes a feasibility band
#   ``[E_elev − d × TAXI_MAX_GRADE, E_elev + d × TAXI_MAX_GRADE]``.
#   Intersect these bands and clip e_v.  When the intersection is
#   empty (anchors disagree), fall back to the midpoint — Layer 1
#   will eventually reconcile the conflicting anchors.
# (NEIGHBOUR_CLAMP_RADIUS_M is now defined in elevation.py and
# imported at the top of this module.)
